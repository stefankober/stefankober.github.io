  <section><p>(31) Opinion commits strongly to a single view in order to act decisively.
Strategy keeps several possibilities in play in order to act robustly when outcomes are uncertain.</p>
<p>Both are rational. Both are necessary. Both fail when applied outside the conditions under which they work.</p>
<p>The problem is not having opinions.
The problem is using the same kind of commitment everywhere.</p>
<p>(32) Once this distinction is taken seriously, a practical question replaces a theoretical one.</p>
<p>Instead of asking first, “What should I believe?”, the more basic question becomes:
“What kind of situation is this?”</p>
<p>Some situations reward decisive commitment.
Others punish it.</p>
<p>Some situations offer fast feedback and correction.
Others do not.</p>
<p>Some situations give you agency.
Others ask only for orientation or preparation.</p>
<p>(33) Where feedback is local, consequences are shared, and revision is possible, opinion works well.
Strong commitment is not a flaw there. It is what allows coordination and action.</p>
<p>Where feedback is delayed, agency is limited, and consequences are asymmetric or irreversible, strategy is a better choice.
Here, premature certainty becomes a liability.</p>
<p>The same possibility, held with different degrees of commitment, can guide action in one context and mislead in another.</p>
<p>And because people occupy different positions, with different access to feedback and consequence, what is a good opinion for one may be a poor one for someone else.</p>
<p>(34) Seen from this angle, what has historically been called skepticism appears less as a rival position and more as a symptom of a missing distinction.</p>
<p>Much of philosophy proceeds as if opinion were the primary, or even the only, serious mode of thought. It asks what should be believed, defended, or justified, and treats full commitment as the natural posture of reason. Philosophical systems form by stacking commitment on commitment until they reach the sky. But where commitment outruns what a situation can support, tension builds.</p>
<p>Classical skepticism emerges precisely at that limit. Faced with questions that do not admit of decisive closure, it refuses to follow opinion all the way. In its radical forms, it reacts by suspending assent almost everywhere. In its milder forms, it survives only locally, passively, and without reach.</p>
<p>Neither response is sufficient on its own.</p>
<p>Opinion, extended too far, hardens into dogma.
Skepticism, extended too far, thins out the self that would have to commit at all, turning restraint into a constant burden and eroding the will to act.</p>
<p>What both lacked was a clear way to distinguish where commitment is appropriate from where it is not.</p>
<p>That distinction becomes visible once opinion and strategy are separated as different ways of reasoning under different conditions.</p>
<p>(35) From this perspective, skepticism does not need to be adopted, rejected, or rehabilitated.</p>
<p>Its role becomes intelligible.</p>
<p>Historically, skepticism arises as a corrective where commitment outruns what a situation can support. It pushes back against the tendency of opinion to harden too quickly, to extend itself beyond the conditions that make it reliable.</p>
<p>As long as no other mode of reasoning is available, that corrective pressure has only two options: to follow opinion all the way, or to resist it almost everywhere. This is why skepticism so often appears either radical or thin.</p>
<p>Once strategy is recognized as a distinct way of reasoning under uncertainty, that pressure no longer needs to harden into a stance. The impulse behind skepticism can remain what it was at its best: restraint where restraint is warranted.</p>
<p>What matters then is not allegiance to a philosophical position, but the practical ability to tell situations apart.</p>
<p>Some situations call for strong commitment.
Others call for preparation, caution, or patience.</p>
<p>Knowing the difference is not a theory to be defended.
It is a form of judgment exercised in practice.</p>
<p>(36) What this perspective clarifies is a persistent confusion.</p>
<p>The strength of commitment that works well in small, lived contexts does not carry over unchanged to larger, more opaque ones.</p>
<p>In familiar settings, strong commitment is supported by direct experience, shared consequences, and the possibility of correction. There, opinion orients action.</p>
<p>When the same degree of commitment is carried into situations where feedback is delayed, agency is limited, and consequences are diffuse or irreversible, it no longer orients. It hardens.</p>
<p>The error is not opinion itself, but treating one level of commitment as universally appropriate.</p>
<p>Learning to adjust commitment to situation is not a matter of holding better views. It is a matter of recognizing what the situation can actually support.</p>
<p>(37) This shift has concrete effects.</p>
<p>It changes what disagreement is about.</p>
<p>When commitment is calibrated to situation, disagreement no longer has to signal ignorance, bad faith, or moral failure. It can remain what it often is in practice: a difference in assumptions, constraints, time horizons, or risk tolerance.</p>
<p>This alters the texture of conflict. Fewer disagreements are forced into the register of character and identity. Fewer positions have to be defended as verdicts about who someone is rather than judgments about what might work.</p>
<p>Disagreement becomes something that can be explored rather than resolved, compared rather than won.</p>
<p>Under these conditions, coordination no longer depends on shared belief. It can proceed through shared awareness of uncertainty, tradeoffs, and limits.</p>
<p>The moral temperature drops not because people care less, but because fewer questions are asked to carry more weight than they can bear.</p>
<p>(38) Within that space, other things become possible.</p>
<p>It becomes permissible not to have an opinion.</p>
<p>Silence is acceptable where nothing useful can be said.</p>
<p>Preparation becomes a legitimate response where judgment would only be an empty performance.</p>
<p>These changes are not dramatic. They do not promise wisdom or consensus.</p>
<p>But they alter what belief is asked to do. Commitment no longer has to outrun situation.</p>
<p>Much of the friction disappears simply because belief is no longer forced to carry work it cannot do.</p>
<p>(39) In a world that constantly demands answers, this restraint can matter.</p>
<p>We are asked to judge situations we cannot influence and processes we cannot see through. Orientation is demanded where action is impossible. Opinion rushes in to fill the gap, and fatigue follows. And the feed is virtually infinite, so the demand never relaxes.</p>
<p>A practical balance between opinion and strategy does not deny these conditions. It accepts them and adjusts commitment accordingly.</p>
<p>Not every situation calls for judgment. Some call for preparation. Some call for waiting. Treating all of them as if they demanded belief is what drains attention and dulls responsibility.</p>
<p>(40) Read this way, the distinction we began with comes into focus as a practice.</p>
<p>Not a theory of the world, but a way of standing in it.</p>
<p>Not a demand for certainty, but the ability to adjust commitment to situation.</p>
<p>Some situations call for decisive judgment. Others call for patience, preparation, or restraint. Most call for something in between.</p>
<p>Belief does not need to settle everything for life to go on. Action does not require certainty to be responsible.</p>
<p>Giving opinion and strategy each their rightful place is a form of competence.</p>
