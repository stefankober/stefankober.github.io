They don't speak in words, they cannot be translated without changing them, but they can change you. They cannot be summoned, but they come with beauty and love.\nThat is how they appear, and how they remain with us.\nIt can be a sunset, a foggy forest, an empty street, or nothing special at all.\nThese moments take hold of you in ways that are surprising, strong and formative.\nWhen I speak to people about such moments, they usually immediately know what I am talking about.\nThat recognition, however, comes more easily than any clear account of what such moments are.\nAs soon as one tries to speak about such moments more carefully, the language begins to slip, and it becomes hard to speak of them instead of from them.\nIn fact, describing them negatively, as what they are not, seems most accurate and to the point.\nThey come unbidden and cannot be forced, though one may, at best, be loosely prepared for them.\nThey resist being put into words.\nThey have positive impact, without being instructions, or even propositional at all.\nThey reorient you, like when you wander through a city, recognize a building or a corner, and suddenly realize that you are not walking west as you had assumed, but east. It's not the world that turns around then, but rather your orientation turns around and is integrated into a wider whole.\nMoments are unrepeatable, and cannot be possessed or stockpiled. Once one tries to hold on to them, they immediately lose their character and become a comparable thing among things.\nIf their absolute meaningfulness is taken seriously, the usual ways of explaining things also begin to fail.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/moments/01-rare-moments/","title":"1. Rare Moments"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/moments/02-sources-of-meaning/":{"body":"When we try to understand where meaning comes from, certain answers suggest themselves almost automatically.\nFor a long time, religion and metaphysics provided such answers. In many contexts, reason has taken their place.\nTogether, these approaches define the familiar space within which questions of meaning are usually addressed.\nIt remains to be seen whether any of them can account for what moments present.\nReligion And Metaphysics\nReligion and metaphysics were, for a long time, the natural places to turn when questions of absolute meaning arose. They do not hesitate where other approaches do. They speak of ultimates: of God, of the Good, of Being, of a final order that grounds why anything matters at all. In this sense, they are uniquely suited to the task. They do not shy away from absolutes; they promise them.\nIt is therefore tempting to understand moments through their language. Moments seem to carry a weight that exceeds all relative concerns. They arrive with a seriousness that feels unconditional. Religion and metaphysics appear to offer exactly what is needed here: a framework in which such seriousness has a name, a source, and a place in the structure of reality.\nAnd yet, something does not fit.\nReligion and metaphysics explain absolute meaning by locating it elsewhere: in a transcendent order, a divine will, a metaphysical ground. Meaning, on these accounts, comes from above, beyond, or behind the world we inhabit. It is secured by doctrines, principles, or ultimate entities. Moments, however, do not present themselves in this way. They do not announce a doctrine, reveal a law, or disclose a structure of reality. They do not tell you what the absolute is, nor where it resides.\nMore importantly, they do not bind. They do not command belief, obedience, or allegiance. They do not ask to be integrated into a system of thought or practice. Whatever their force, it is not the force of revelation in the traditional sense. They do not found a religion, nor do they confirm one. When taken seriously, they remain strangely unaligned with dogma.\nThere is also a more practical tension. Religion and metaphysics aim at shared truth. They make claims that are meant to hold not only for one person, but for all. They seek articulation, transmission, teaching. Moments resist this. They are not objects of agreement or disagreement. They cannot be passed on intact. They remain bound to the life in which they occur, even as they orient and integrate it.\nFor these reasons, religion and metaphysics feel both too strong and too rigid. They expect more than moments give, and give more than moments ask for. They explain absolute meaning by filling it with content, while moments present absolute meaningfulness without content. What they offer overshoots the phenomenon.\nThis does not make religion or metaphysics false. It means only that, when it comes to accounting for what moments present, they miss their mark. They explain something else: something more articulate, more stable, more sayable.\nThere is also a more basic difficulty. Even if religion and metaphysics could explain moments contentually, they can no longer do so formally. They no longer stand as unquestioned sources of meaning.\nTo explain the meaning of moments by appeal to religion or metaphysics would reverse the order of grounding. It would not be religion or metaphysics that clarify the meaning of moments, but moments that would clarify the meaning of religion or metaphysics. Whatever one thinks of these traditions, this is no longer how explanation can work. Religion and metaphysics no longer carry meaning with that force.\nThis becomes evident as soon as one tries to carry out such an explanation. Which religion, which metaphysics would one choose, and why? Their plurality does not strengthen their explanatory power. It dissolves it.\nReason\nReason approaches questions of meaning from a very different angle. It does not promise absolutes, and it does not speak of ultimates. Its strength lies elsewhere. Reason is empirical, comparative, and fallible. It explains by relating things to other things: by causes, correlations, functions, and histories. It asks how something came to be, how it works, and under which conditions it can be expected to occur again.\nIn many contexts, this has made reason the dominant source of orientation. Where religion and metaphysics once offered comprehensive answers, reason offers reliability. It does not claim to tell us what ultimately matters, but it tells us what is the case, what follows from what, and what we can reasonably expect. Its authority is not derived from revelation or doctrine, but from method and success.\nAt first glance, this seems well suited to moments. Moments occur in the world. They happen to embodied people, at particular times and places. Reason can describe their conditions, their triggers, and their effects. It can speak of psychological states, neurological processes, social contexts, and personal histories. It can explain why such experiences tend to occur in certain situations and not in others.\nAnd yet, here too, something does not fit.\nReason explains by generalization. It seeks patterns, regularities, and repeatable structures. What it explains, it explains as an instance of a type. Moments resist this. They matter precisely as singular. They are not experienced as examples of a class, nor as outcomes of a process that could, in principle, be run again. When treated as such, their character is lost. What reason gains in explanatory power, it pays for by dissolving what made the moment matter in the first place.\nMore importantly, reason explains by reduction. It accounts for phenomena by relating them to more basic components or more general mechanisms. In doing so, it necessarily shifts attention away from what is immediately given. Moments, however, do not present themselves as composites to be analyzed. They present themselves as wholes. Their meaningfulness is not the sum of contributing factors. Knowing more about their causes does not deepen their meaning. It often does the opposite.\nThere is also a categorical limit. Reason is, by its own standards, relative. Its claims are always conditional: valid under certain assumptions, within certain models, given certain evidence. This is its virtue. But absolute meaningfulness is not conditional in this way. It does not appear as \"meaningful given that...\". It appears as meaningful in itself. Reason can describe this appearance, but it cannot underwrite it without stepping beyond its own domain.\nFinally, reason is silent on why anything should matter at all. It can tell us how values emerge, how they function, and how they change. It cannot tell us why they should bind us. When applied to moments, this silence becomes audible. Reason can explain that a moment had an impact, and how it reoriented a life. It cannot explain why that reorientation should be taken seriously.\nThis is not a failure of reason, but a boundary of it. Reason does exactly what it is meant to do. It explains within the world, not the world as meaningful. When confronted with moments, it can clarify, contextualize, and demystify. What it cannot do is account for their absolute meaningfulness without transforming it into something else, without discarding them as what they present themselves to be.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/moments/02-sources-of-meaning/","title":"2. Sources Of Meaning"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/moments/03-the-edge-of-an-opening/":{"body":"Reason is our standpoint.\nBut it is not the standpoint of the donkey or the bee.\nThey have no reasons to give, nor can they judge ours. What we call reasoning does not belong to their way of being.\nBy analogy, there may be ways of making sense of the world that we cannot imagine, that remain unintelligible to us.\nThis would mark a territory we can approach only to its edge. Beyond that edge, there is nothing for us.\nBut it may not be nothing in an absolute sense.\nAcknowledging this possibility adds nothing to what exists, and it takes nothing away from the authority of reason.\nIt merely marks a possibility: that reason may encounter an opening it can recognize but cannot enter.\nWhether anything lies beyond that edge is not something reason can decide.\nNo explanation can come from there either.\nSo are moments, in the end, nothing at all?\nIt is tempting to dismiss them. They may appear intense, memorable, even transformative, and still amount to nothing more than psychological events: flukes of the mind, products of mood, memory, or circumstance. On this view, moments would be no different in kind from passing emotions or illusions that feel significant only while they last.\nThis temptation is not frivolous. It follows directly from our usual explanatory habits. What cannot be integrated into our frameworks of meaning is often treated as noise. What cannot be accounted for is often set aside. From this perspective, moments seem to occupy an uncomfortable position: they demand seriousness, yet refuse explanation; they claim importance, yet offer no justification.\nIf explanation were the only measure of significance, this would settle the matter. Moments would be experiences we happen to have, not things that matter. They would be psychologically interesting, perhaps even powerful, but ultimately empty.\nThis conclusion is difficult to avoid, and it deserves to be faced directly.\nAnd yet, this conclusion moves too quickly.\nMoments are real events in a human life, and they have causes. They occur in minds and bodies, and they can, in principle, be described in psychological or neurological terms. But that is not what is at issue here. The question is not how moments arise, but what becomes of their significance. Explaining their occurrence does not explain what they do. To confuse these levels is to mistake causation for meaning.\nThe inability to explain the meaning of moments does not, by itself, license their dismissal as meaningful. Explanation is not the only way something can matter. To discard moments simply because they cannot be integrated into our existing sources of meaning is to assume, without argument, that these sources are exhaustive. But this is precisely what has been called into question.\nAcknowledging an opening at the boundary of reason does not explain moments. It does not ground them, justify them, or elevate them into a higher order. What it does is more modest and more important. It prevents a premature closure. What cannot be decided by reason cannot be eliminated by it either. Enumeration and exclusion reach their limit here.\nMoments, then, are not secured by explanation, but neither are they undone by its absence. Their force remains, even when no account can be given. They do not fit into our world as we understand it, but they occur within our lives nonetheless. Treating them as nothing would require an act of dismissal that goes beyond what reason itself can warrant.\nAt this point, the question shifts. It is no longer a question of explanation, but of response. If moments are neither grounded nor refuted by our sources of meaning, then what remains is how they orient us: how they reconfigure our sense of what matters, without telling us what to think or believe.\nCould this role not be played by other experiences as well? Dreams, artistic absorption, intoxication, religious feeling, all can be intense, disorienting, and meaningful. But these experiences enter our shared world differently. They invite explanation, interpretation, or dispute. They can be compared, classified, reproduced, or dismissed. One can argue about what they are, whether they are genuine, or what they signify.\nMoments, as they appear here, do none of this. They do not ask to be believed, defended, or interpreted. They do not present themselves as messages, symbols, or signs. Their existence is not a matter for debate, because they are not objects in the world that others could confirm or deny. They matter only to the one who encounters them, and they matter without making a claim. This is what allows them to orient a life without becoming part of an explanatory system.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/moments/03-the-edge-of-an-opening/","title":"3. The Edge Of An Opening"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/moments/04-the-opening-of-an-edge/":{"body":"It seems that we find ourselves on one side of an edge.\nNot everybody on the same side. Not once and for all. But on one side, for now.\nThis is not a matter of belief. It is not the acceptance of a hidden truth, nor the assertion of something unseen. Nothing is claimed about what exists, and nothing is known that was not known before.\nOne does not stand on this side of the edge because one has learned something, but because something has come to count. Moments are not taken as evidence, nor as messages. They come to matter, without being explained, justified, or secured.\nNor does one stand on the other side because of greater or lesser knowledge. One may simply find that moments do not count in this way, and let them fade as passing states without further weight.\nTo stand here is not to hold a position, but to adopt a way of bearing what has occurred. Nothing is inferred from moments, and nothing is concluded from them. One lets them reorient attention and weight, without turning them into reasons. This stance remains exposed. It does not protect itself by certainty, and it does not settle the question it opens.\nThe same is true of standing there. The doubt can never leave. There is no closure.\nWhen one stands here, certain things begin to lose their grip. Not because they are rejected, but because their claim to absolute importance weakens. The constant pressure to perform, to justify oneself, to secure one's place among others no longer occupies the center. The moment reoriented you into a silent absolutely meaningful whole. Money, status, recognition, even being right, remain in place, but they become relative. They no longer present themselves as final goals, but as instruments among others, useful at times, empty at others.\nThe position of the ego shifts in such a reorientation. It is not denied, disciplined, or overcome. It is simply no longer sovereign. Moments do not flatter the self, and they do not confirm it. They place it within something larger, without naming what that is. In doing so, they quietly decenter the ego. It is no longer the measure of all that matters.\nThis reweighting does not arrive as an instruction. It does not tell you how to act, nor what to pursue. It changes what seems worth pursuing in the first place. Certain justifications lose their force. Appeals to entitlement, resentment, or self-importance sound hollow. Not because they are refuted, but because they no longer resonate.\nOther people, in turn, appear differently. If moments are possible for oneself, they are possible for anyone. This does not confer a duty, and it does not ground a rule. It alters perspective. Other lives are no longer primarily means, obstacles, or competitors within a shared game. They present themselves as ends in their own right, not by argument, but by analogy of exposure and belonging to the same nameless whole.\nNothing here depends on assuming that moments are real in any stronger sense than that they occur. The moment changes you, or it doesn't. None of this can remove doubt. The possibility remains that all of this is empty, a coincidence of mind and circumstance. But doubt does not function like a refutation. What has shifted is not a belief that could simply be withdrawn, but an orientation that may persist, fade, or be revised over time.\nUtilitarianism offers a striking contrast here. It is, in many ways, the ethical language of our time. Clear, scalable, and impartial, it promises orientation without mystery. It asks us to weigh outcomes, to minimize harm, to maximize well-being. It is sober where older moral vocabularies were emphatic, procedural where they were declarative. For many purposes, it works remarkably well.\nHeld against the standpoint of moments, however, the difference between the two becomes apparent. Utilitarianism treats value as something that can be aggregated, compared, and optimized. What matters is what can be counted: pleasure and pain, benefit and cost, preference and satisfaction. Meaning, on this view, is inseparable from consequences. It is always relative to a calculus, even when the calculus is humane and carefully constructed.\nThis way of inhabiting the world is not wrong. But it is markedly different from the orientation that emerges when moments are taken seriously. Moments do not present themselves as quantities, nor as outcomes to be optimized. They do not set goals, nor do they offer criteria by which to rank actions. Their force is not comparative. It is absolute in a different sense: not as a command, but as a reweighting.\nWithin utilitarian reasoning, moments have no clear role. If something cannot be justified by its consequences, if it cannot be shown to increase overall good, then its significance seems fragile, perhaps illusory. Moments, by contrast, do not justify themselves at all. They do not answer the question \"what should I do?\" They alter the interrogator, and with that, the criteria.\nUtilitarianism remains tied to the ego, even when it asks that ego to be impartial. It presupposes an agent who calculates, chooses, and bears responsibility for outcomes. Moments decenter that agent. They do not dissolve responsibility, but they loosen how responsibility can be used for self-justification.\nNothing here suggests abandoning utilitarian reasoning. In favor of what? Moments do not form an ethical theory.\nBut there is a contrast to be seen here, one that cannot be shown in another way. It concerns what ultimately orients us when no calculation settles the matter, and no justification satisfies.\nTo live with moments in this way is to live without closure. There is no message to decipher, no guarantee to rely on, no point at which the question settles. Nothing arrives that confirms one was right to take them seriously. Nothing arrives that proves one was mistaken either. One simply continues, with an orientation that remains exposed.\nThere is no higher standpoint from which this way of living can be justified. There is no such standpoint from which it can be dismissed. It proceeds without warrant and without defense. One lives neither as if something has been revealed, nor as if nothing has occurred. One lives attentively, without knowing to what.\nThis is not a solution. It is not an answer to the question of meaning. It is a way of staying with the question.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/moments/04-the-opening-of-an-edge/","title":"4.

As adults, we are expected to decide and act. We are asked to take responsibility for outcomes we cannot fully foresee, and to justify commitments we did not freely choose in the first place.\nAre our actions determined, or do we genuinely decide?\nDo our choices matter, or are they just motions in a larger mechanism?\nWhatever the answer, we still have to act.\nWe plan, we judge, we promise, we accuse, we excuse. We assign praise and blame. We enter contracts, pursue projects, and hold one another responsible. All of this presupposes that thinking can guide action in some meaningful way.\nYet certainty is rare, if it exists at all.\nSome claims are easier to assess than others. Statements about the near future can be checked when the result arrives. Claims about the past rely on evidence and testimony. Harder still are counterfactuals: what would have happened if things had gone differently. Counterfactuals never occur. And yet they are indispensable. Without them, planning collapses, forensic reasoning breaks down, and responsibility becomes unintelligible.\nSo what, exactly, can our thinking accomplish?\nOften our actions do bring about the goals we set. Not always, but often enough that total skepticism rings false. And yet we regularly find ourselves unable to decisively justify why one course of action was right and another wrong, why one belief was warranted and another merely convenient.\nThis uncertainty does not stay in the study. It reaches into courts and contracts, into politics and ethics, into how we understand ourselves as agents over time.\nThe problem is not that the question of truth has been settled and forgotten. It is the opposite. There is a long history of attempts to fix truth once and for all, and a long history of those attempts failing. Skepticism has never quite won. Neither has certainty.\nInstead, we oscillate. At times convinced, at times doubtful. When pressed for reasons, we often discover that what we took for grounding was little more than habit, inheritance, or momentum.\nWe live with commitments we cannot fully justify, and doubts we cannot fully sustain.\nIs truth still worth caring about?\nIf not, what could take its place?\nAnd if it is, what kind of truth could survive the conditions we actually live under?\nIf neither certainty nor skepticism can be sustained, something else has to carry the weight. Not a final answer, but a way of standing in the world that allows thinking and acting to continue without pretending that the great questions have been settled.\nWhat matters then may not be fixing truth once and for all, but cultivating the ability to orient ourselves under uncertainty.

A breeze. The soft rustle of leaves. Something solid. Something shared.\nA friend passes by and asks, gently, in conversation:\n\"What tree do you mean?\"\nNot as a joke.\nNo metaphor.\nThey simply don't see it.\nThat would feel absurd. Mad. Kafkaesque.\nYou see the tree. You can touch it, walk around it. This is the old, shared world we live in. All of science, the rule of law, cooperation, responsibility, and planning presuppose that we inhabit the same world, and that we can talk about it together.\nIn such cases, truth seems straightforward.\n\"There is a tree.\"\n\"The tree is sixteen meters high.\"\nWe can go there. We can check. We can measure.\nIt is easy to agree on trees.\nAnd abandoning truth here is not an option. Truth is not an abstract ideal we could simply give up. It carries our practices, our coordination, our sense of reality itself.\nThe difficulty begins elsewhere.\nWhat about justice? Love? Purpose?\nThe very things that orient our lives.\nHere the question is no longer only how our words relate to the world, but what these things even are, if anything at all. What would it mean to be wrong about them? What would it mean to be right?\nWe rely on truth in practice while lacking clarity about its reach. Not because we are careless, but because there is no neutral standpoint from which to resolve this once and for all.\nThis tension has consequences.\nPeople can succeed by every external measure and still feel lost. When you no longer know what truly convinces you, or feel forced to perform conviction, you begin to disappear from your own life.\nOthers grow silent, not because they have nothing to say, but because disagreement feels like a fight. As if every opinion were either a weapon or a confession of ignorance.\nAnd then there are cases that reveal how deep divergence can run without us noticing.\nSome years ago, a psychological study by Russell Hurlburt made headlines: some people don't have an inner monologue. At all. No voice in their heads. No running commentary. Just silence. They function perfectly well. They're articulate, thoughtful, successful.\nThey simply don't narrate their lives internally the way many others do.\nAnd many of them have no idea that others do.\nA similar pattern appears with aphantasia. People grow up assuming that phrases like \"mental image\" or \"visualize it\" are metaphors. Only later, sometimes decades later, do they realize that others actually experience mental pictures.\nThey don't. They never have.\nThese differences can remain invisible for a long time. When they are discovered, they often reframe a person's understanding of themselves. Not because something was wrong before, but because something that had always worked was never examined.\nSuch divergence exists at the most basic level of experience. What is striking is not that these differences exist, but that everyday life proceeds so smoothly without anyone needing to notice them.\nWe are good at doing things together. We are less practiced at reflecting on how that coordination is possible.\nWhat else might function reliably while remaining poorly understood? What else about ourselves might matter, without yet having found a clear language for it?\nAnd how could questions like these be connected to talk of a \"demise of truth\"? What would such a phrase even mean in a world that works as well as it does?\nThe Enduring Allure Of Truth\nTruth has always held us.\nFrom ancient philosophers to modern scientists, we have appealed to it across centuries, not only in theory, but in courtrooms, classrooms, family arguments, and quiet moments of doubt.\nTruth is not just a philosophical ideal. It organizes our daily lives. We act on what we take to be true. We react sharply to dishonesty and deception. Relationships can end over the loss of trust, over the sense that something true has been violated.\nMuch of this rests on a simple picture. That our statements and thoughts relate to the world by matching it. That they say how things are. That others, given the same situation, should be able to see this too.\nThis is the picture at work when we cannot imagine that there are trees for some people, but not for others. It is the assumption that the world is simply there, shared, and available to be described. In most everyday situations, this works remarkably well.\nThe difficulty begins when we extend this picture beyond the domains where it quietly succeeds. When we expect truth to settle questions of meaning, value, purpose, or direction in the same way. When disagreement no longer looks like a difference in perspective, but like error, confusion, or bad faith.\nAt that point, truth can begin to feel less like a guide and more like a constraint. Not because it is false, but because it is asked to do more than it can reliably do.\nWhat if the problem is not that truth has failed us, but that we are looking in the wrong place?\nWhat if, instead of trying to reinterpret truth once more, we shifted our attention to something more basic?\nTo what convinces us, and why.\nThe Limits Of Truth\nTruth carries an extraordinary amount of weight.\nWe invoke it in science and law, in education and planning, in personal relationships and political disputes. Few concepts are as central to how we coordinate our lives.\nAt the same time, it has proven remarkably resistant to clear definition.\nAcross centuries of philosophical debate, no account of truth has managed to settle the matter decisively. Competing theories illuminate different aspects of how truth functions, but none resolves all tensions. This persistence of disagreement is not a sign of carelessness. It points to something structurally difficult about the concept itself.\nThis difficulty would matter little if truth played only a limited role. But it does not. We rely on it constantly, often without noticing how much work we expect it to do.\nWhen truth seems to guide us reliably, this causes little trouble. But when it no longer provides orientation, familiar patterns emerge.\nOne response is nihilism: the sense that meaning and truth were never really there to begin with, that they are inventions rather than discoveries.\nAnother response is relativism: the idea that truth is always relative to perspectives, cultures, or frameworks, and that no standpoint has priority over another.\nA third response is skepticism: the persistent doubt that asks whether any belief can be justified at all, or whether certainty is ever more than an illusion.\nThese are often treated as philosophical positions to be defended or rejected. But they can also be understood differently: as ways the strain on the concept of truth becomes visible.\nThey arise not because truth is unimportant, but because it is asked to do more than it can reliably do. Fundamental to our practices, yet unclear in its limits, truth becomes a point of pressure.\nDoesn't the concept of truth invite these responses precisely because it is so deeply embedded in how we live, while it also remains difficult to define or delimit?\nA Different Perspective\nIt may be time to shift our perspective on truth.\nNot to reject it, and not to claim its problems are insoluble, but to loosen its grip on questions it was never meant to answer on its own.\nMuch of what we call \"truth\" actually bundles together two different concerns.\nOne concerns how convictions form and change. How people come to hold certain beliefs, how those beliefs gain force, how they stabilize, conflict, or collapse. This is a question about mechanisms, histories, and structures of conviction.\nThe other concerns how, and under what conditions, convictions relate to the world. Whether what we believe corresponds to what exists, what happens, or what would happen under certain circumstances. This is the traditional domain of truth theory.\nThese two concerns are closely connected. But they are not the same.\nHere is the surprising part: in many situations where we reach for truth-talk, what we actually need is clarity about conviction formation. Invoking truth does not always help. Sometimes it obscures what is really going on.\nWe do not usually lack a metaphysical anchor. We lack insight into how convictions arise, how they gain authority, and how they change.\nConviction Formation Theory focuses on that prior layer. It does not begin by asking whether a belief is true. It asks how it becomes believable. How it persuades, resists doubt, shapes action, and survives encounter with alternatives.\nOne might object that truth is precisely what makes beliefs believable. That conviction and truth cannot be separated.\nThat thought has a strong pull. And it points to a real connection.\nBut we do not, in fact, have a settled account of what truth is. That is the difficulty that has followed us throughout this discussion. Conviction formation, by contrast, exhibits recognizable patterns, even though its outcomes vary widely.\nConvictions are personal. They depend on experience, context, exposure, and risk. No two people arrive at what they hold most deeply in exactly the same way.\nConviction Formation Theory offers a way to examine these processes without pretending to resolve the question of truth first.\nInstead of asking, \"Is this true?\" it asks, \"How did this come to convince us?\"\nWhat Are Convictions?\nA conviction is something a person is convinced of. It may take the form of a factual claim (\"This car is green\", \"This food is good\") or a rule that guides action (\"One should keep promises\", \"Lying is wrong\").\nTo be convinced of something is not merely to assent to it verbally. It is to rely on it. Convictions show themselves in how we plan, decide, act, and think.\nCan we examine our own convictions directly? To some extent, yes.\nWe can list what we currently believe about what we see, hear, remember, or expect. But the deeper rules we follow are rarely given to us explicitly. Identifying them takes effort. It requires self-observation, attention to patterns, and often deliberate reflection.\nWe come to recognize our convictions by watching what they do. How we defend certain ideas, where we invest time and energy, what risks we take, and which options never seriously occur to us all reveal what we are convinced of, whether we would phrase it that way or not.\nAfter all, we did not construct these rules from first principles before using them.\nUnderstanding oneself is not easy.\nWe recognize convictions in others in much the same way, though without direct access. Signs include genuine consent or resistance, instinctive defense of an idea, and the willingness to take risks, whether in argument, commitment, or action.\nConvictions often become most visible in moments of authenticity, when action is less filtered and less strategic. In such moments, we may even notice convictions in others that they themselves have not yet articulated.\nConvictions are not fixed. They can shift gradually, or change abruptly in response to powerful experiences. Under strong emotion, they may fluctuate temporarily, only to settle again once the situation passes. A person may feel justified in an action during anger or despair, and later judge it differently.\nEven so, convictions are usually stable. They are not chosen at will. They persist until something genuinely convinces us otherwise.\nYou have your convictions.\nAnd they change when something succeeds in changing them.\nHow Do Convictions Relate To Truth?\nTruth and conviction are not the same, but they often take the same form.\nA statement like \"The car is red\" can be approached as a truth claim and examined in terms of correspondence with the world. Or it can be approached as a conviction, examined in terms of how it arose, stabilized, and came to guide action.\nWhat changes is not the sentence itself, but the mode of engagement. Are we asking whether it matches the world, or how it emerged as something we rely on in the first place? Sometimes we describe that reliance in the language of truth, sometimes we do not.\nTruths and convictions share important features. Both shape our understanding of the world, guide our actions, and help us navigate reality.\nBoth also exhibit a kind of resistance. A conviction, like a truth claim, does not usually feel optional. It presents itself as something we cannot simply set aside at will. In this sense, both truth and conviction are binding.\nBoth are also connected to justification. When we claim something is true, we offer reasons, arguments, or evidence. When we hold a conviction, we do the same. In everyday practice, these justifications often look indistinguishable.\nFinally, both truth and conviction can be shared. Societies develop collective convictions just as they develop accepted truths: about laws, morals, scientific principles, and historical events. These shared structures allow coordination, continuity, and collective action.\nTruth and conviction are not identical. But they echo each other in structure, in force, and in function. Recognizing this resemblance without collapsing the distinction is the key to understanding how they interact.\nHow Are Convictions Different From Truth?\nTruth and convictions are both binding, but they bind in different ways.\nA truth presents itself as binding because it claims to reflect a reality that is independent of us. It is supposed to hold whether anyone believes it or not.\nA conviction, by contrast, binds because we hold it. It guides our thinking and action because nothing has yet convinced us otherwise. Convictions are not chosen at will, but they can, in principle, be replaced when something succeeds in changing them.\nDespite this difference, convictions often carry a sense of independence as well. When two people disagree about something that matters to them, they usually try to reach a common understanding. Each brings convictions about how agreement should be reached, what counts as a good reason, and what should settle the matter. If they disagree there, the discussion simply shifts to a higher level.\nIn this way, convictions can feel as firm and resistant as truths.\nA crucial difference lies in stability. Truth claims present themselves as fixed. Even when we say \"nothing will ever convince me otherwise\", what we usually mean is that we cannot imagine such a change. History shows that imagination is a poor guide here. Convictions do change, sometimes slowly, sometimes suddenly, often in ways we could not have predicted.\nTruth claims are meant to be true independently of who holds them. Convictions, by contrast, bind first and foremost the person who holds them. They have psychological, social, historical, and rational dimensions. They are shaped by experience, learning, trust, and exposure.\nThis also explains a difference in plurality. There is supposed to be one truth, but there can be many convictions. People can hold incompatible convictions and still function together in the same world. Tension arises not because plurality exists, but because coordination sometimes requires alignment.\nContradictory truth claims generate tension by definition. Contradictory convictions generate tension primarily when they coexist within the same person, or when cooperation demands resolution.\nThis difference becomes clearer in cases often considered paradigms of truth.\nTake mathematical statements like the square root of two is irrational or in a right triangle, a² + b² = c². These are commonly treated as unquestionable truths, supported by proofs.\nAnd yet, most of us do not relate to them through personal verification. We have not worked through the proofs ourselves, and many of us would not know how to begin. We rely on teachers, textbooks, institutions, and a chain of trust. Over time, repetition and reinforcement turn these statements into convictions that feel certain.\nThis does not make them false. But it shows that, for most of us, their binding force comes from conviction rather than direct rational grounding.\nIf this is true even in such cases, it is worth asking how many of our other \"truths\" function in the same way.\nConvictions are the resistant material of our thinking. They are what we actually rely on. They do not always form through processes we would later describe as fully rational or truth-aimed.\nIn fact, we hold convictions about what \"rational\" and \"true\" mean, which usually did not form rationally or through direct access to the meaning, but in a similar way our convictions about the irrationality of the square root of two did.\nUnderstanding this shifts attention to the processes by which reason, truth, and certainty come to matter to us in the first place.\nThe Social Nature Of Convictions\nConvictions do not form in isolation. Personal experience and reflection matter, but the influence of others is pervasive. Authority figures such as parents, teachers, experts, and peers shape convictions early on. Social groups reinforce them through shared assumptions and unspoken norms. Even repetition alone can strengthen a conviction, whether or not it has been critically examined.\nAnd critical examination itself is never neutral. It relies on rules of thinking we are already convinced will lead us in the right direction.\nConvictions leave traces. They shape behavior, decision-making, and communication. For this reason, they are not purely private. At least in part, they are accessible to empirical study.\nWe can observe how convictions manifest in action: in decisions made under pressure, in patterns of consistency or inconsistency, in responses to moral dilemmas. We can probe their strength by looking at what people are willing to risk for them, how they respond to counterarguments, or how their views shift over time. Indirect questioning can sometimes reveal convictions that are not explicitly acknowledged, especially where stated beliefs diverge from action.\nStill, convictions are not always easy to isolate. Some remain deeply embedded and unarticulated, shaping behavior in ways that are difficult to trace back to a single source.\nConvictions are also historical. They emerge within social contexts that themselves carry histories. What we take to be normal, rational, or self-evident today is often the sediment of earlier debates, decisions, and practices that continue to shape us long after they have faded from view.\nThe Idea Of Truth And The Reality Of Conviction\nBut is the abstract notion of truth dispensable? What allows us to distinguish reliable convictions from unreliable ones? On what basis do we justify such distinctions?\nTo approach these questions, it helps to look at how things actually work in practice.\nScience, for example, does not require access to ultimate truths in order to succeed. It advances by developing and refining conviction structures that predict, explain, and withstand challenge. Scientific claims gain strength by surviving scrutiny, resisting refutation, and proving useful across contexts and over time. Whether they correspond to reality in some final sense is a further question, one that scientific practice itself does not settle.\nSomething similar holds in ethics, law, and governance. What is enforced are not abstract truths, but shared convictions that function as guiding principles. These convictions can be tested, revised, and replaced. Their authority depends less on metaphysical grounding than on their ability to orient action, resolve conflict, and endure reflection.\nTruth appears, at first glance, to offer a clean way of distinguishing valid beliefs from invalid ones. And yet, we do not have direct access to truth itself. What we have are convictions about what is true, and convictions that some of our convictions are likely to be true. These are not arranged in a system that guarantees truth preservation from first principles downward. They rest on a broad, largely unexamined background of convictions that guide everyday reasoning and action.\nTruth theory remains a legitimate and distinct philosophical endeavor, and it should remain so.\nAt the same time, the remarkable success of science, and even our modest success in navigating daily life, would be hard to explain if there were no underlying correspondence at all between thought and reality. For this reason, the idea of truth tends to reappear within Conviction Formation Theory, not as a proven foundation, but as a powerful and widely shared meta-conviction: the conviction that our convictions are, at least in part and often enough, answerable to a world that exists independently of us.\nThis meta-conviction is compelling.\nConsider a simple case. You remember an event one way. Someone you trust remembers it differently. If you assume that one of you must be mistaken, you are already relying on a higher-order conviction: that the world has a single, coherent history, and that incompatible convictions about it cannot all be correct.\nIf philosophers or scientists were ever to establish a final and unquestionable link between thought and reality, this conviction might become knowledge. Until then, it functions as an ideal we rely on, not a certainty we possess.\nUntil we learn to fly, we live off the land of convictions.\nThe Power Of Meta-Convictions\nWe do not only form convictions. We also form convictions about convictions. We develop beliefs about how convictions should be formed, how they should be defended, and what it means to act in accordance with them. These higher-order convictions can be called meta-convictions.\nAs individuals, we acquire many of them implicitly, long before we can articulate them. As a species, we inherit them through culture and history, embedded in philosophy, science, religion, and law. They shape how we think long before we think about them.\nFor example, many of us share the meta-conviction that evidence and reasoning matter when forming beliefs. At the same time, we hold convictions about what counts as evidence and what qualifies as good reasoning. These standards are not fixed. They shift with education, experience, and historical context. Some appear to be widespread across cultures; others are clearly contingent.\nMeta-convictions shape which convictions we treat as better or worse, stronger or weaker, more or less defensible. In practice, they often do the work we expect truth to do: they guide evaluation, criticism, and revision.\nWe do not have direct access to truth itself. What we have are convictions, and convictions about how to handle convictions. If there is a correspondence between thought and reality, which seems neither unreasonable nor guaranteed, then our most stable and widely shared meta-convictions are what orient us toward it, however imperfectly.\nConviction Formation Theory is itself a collection of meta-convictions: claims about how convictions arise, stabilize, and change. Like all convictions, these claims are open to examination and revision, using the very meta-convictions that guide inquiry and critique.\nIn this sense, meta-convictions function like an immune system for belief. They help filter out unreliable convictions, resist harmful ones, and adjust our understanding when circumstances change. A weak immune system lets in anything. An overactive one attacks everything, including itself.\nBeyond Nihilism, Relativism, And Skepticism\nNihilism, relativism, and skepticism can be understood as systems of meta-convictions. Each arises from a similar source: the combination of abandoning absolute truth while still treating truth as the only possible validator of belief.\nIn this sense, they resemble overactive immune systems. Faced with uncertainty, they respond not by recalibration, but by rejection: rejecting value, rejecting distinction, or rejecting judgment altogether.\nThis raises an important question. If truth-talk is vulnerable to nihilism, relativism, and skepticism, is conviction language vulnerable in the same way?\nConvictions do not require absolute certainty to matter. They are meaningful because they are embedded in experience, relationship, and aspiration. They enable action, coordination, and self-understanding. Even when proof of truth is unavailable, convictions provide orientation.\nCrucially, convictions cannot all be discarded at once. Even rejection relies on convictions. To abandon one conviction is always to rely on others in its place.\nNihilism: If Convictions Aren't True, Are They Worthless?\nNihilism holds that if convictions cannot be proven true in an absolute sense, they have no value. Historically, this stance gained force as a critique of rigid institutions that claimed truth in order to silence dissent. The impulse to \"strike out right and left\" was, at first, a tool of liberation.\nBut once proof of absolute truth is made the sole criterion of value, the logic does not stop. If nothing can meet that standard, then everything collapses, including the nihilistic principle itself.\nFrom the perspective of Conviction Formation Theory, nihilism rests on a single sweeping conviction: that what cannot be proven true has no worth and must be dismantled. This one belief is then used to override all others.\nOrdinary conviction structures do not work this way. They are not monolithic. They are webs of interdependent beliefs, shaped by experience, reinforced by practice, and revised over time. Nothing in them is absolute, but neither are they arbitrarily dismissible.\nNihilism is therefore not the absence of conviction, but a severely impoverished conviction system: one that reduces all meaning to its negation without showing why such a reduction is necessary.\nRelativism: Are All Convictions Equal?\nRelativism says, \"No conviction is better than any other, yours, mine, or anyone else's.\"\nThe reason usually given is that none of them can be proven true in an absolute sense.\nFrom the perspective of Conviction Formation Theory, the reply is not a dismissal but a clarification:\n\"For me, they are not equal. My convictions guide my actions, shape my identity, and structure my life. In a very real sense, they are me. In the absence of proven truth, your generic conviction is simply another conviction. By what force would it override all the others that bind me?\"\nThis response does not deny disagreement. It makes its structure visible.\nRelativism raises an important point: if truth were simple and directly accessible, moral and political disagreement would largely disappear. We would discover the correct answers and converge on them. But that is not the world we inhabit.\nInstead, societies are shaped by overlapping and competing conviction sets: shared beliefs about law, morality, and governance that arise within groups and across traditions. These convictions interact, conflict, and sometimes align. Some gain influence not because they are proven true in an absolute sense, but because they prove more coherent, more stable, or more capable of sustaining collective life.\nThis is why politics exists. It is the space in which conviction sets encounter one another and where rules emerge through negotiation and consequence, not through the revelation of correspondence.\nHistory suggests that certain basic convictions, such as commitments to peace and the rule of law, allow societies to endure, while others undermine their own conditions of possibility. This does not establish their truth in a metaphysical sense. It shows their viability over time.\nFor this reason, even in a conviction-based framework, not all convictions can be treated as equal in practice. Some must be constrained or excluded from power when they threaten the conditions that allow people to live together at all.\nWhat distinguishes convictions here is not correspondence to an external truth, but evidence drawn from historical experience.\nSkepticism: Can We Really Suspend Judgment?\nSkepticism suggests that since nothing can be proven true, judgment should be suspended. In its mild forms, this stance can be intellectually healthy. It resists dogmatism and invites humility.\nBut complete suspension of judgment is not practically sustainable. Convictions assert themselves constantly: in perception, in action, in relationship. One cannot meaningfully live while continuously withholding belief about whether fire burns, whether others exist, or whether decisions matter.\nSuspension of judgment therefore becomes an ongoing effort, not a neutral position. And it is unclear what it ultimately aims at, beyond the hope of avoiding error or achieving peace of mind.\nConviction Formation Theory begins from a similar acknowledgment of uncertainty. But instead of attempting to eliminate conviction, it asks how convictions arise, how they stabilize, and how they change. It shifts the focus from escaping belief to understanding it.\nReclaiming The Right To Hold Convictions\nOne shared danger of nihilism, relativism, and skepticism is that they can undermine our sense of standing in relation to our own convictions. In different ways, they suggest that belief requires a kind of permission it can never quite obtain.\nIn this respect, they resemble certain uses of truth theory itself. When legitimacy depends on external validation by an ideal that remains out of reach, conviction begins to look suspect by default.\nFrom the perspective of Conviction Formation Theory, the idea that one is not entitled to one's own convictions is itself a conviction. It does not stand above the rest. It carries no special authority.\nLetting go of absolute certainty does not mean letting go of engagement, responsibility, or care. It means acknowledging the conditions under which conviction actually forms and operates. This can make room for a more honest relationship to how we think and believe, one that allows for revision without paralysis and commitment without pretense.\nSeen this way, nihilism, relativism, and skepticism can be understood as symptoms of a meta-conviction system that has turned against itself. They emerge from an attempt to purify belief by demanding more than belief can deliver. Instead of protecting conviction, they weaken it.\nWhatever their philosophical merits, they do not relieve us of the need to rely on convictions. No conviction has ever been proven beyond all possible doubt. And yet, we all live by them.\nThe question, then, is not whether our convictions can be justified absolutely.\nIt is how they function, how they came to be, and whether they help us navigate life with coherence, openness, and integrity.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-i/02-beyond-truth-an-invitation-to-conviction-formation-theory/","title":"2. Beyond Truth, An Invitation To Conviction Formation Theory"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-i/03-the-mechanics-of-conviction-formation/":{"body":"The Social Formation Of Convictions\nImagine the Agora of Athens, 2,500 years ago. The heart of the city is alive with movement. Merchants haggle, citizens gather, and, in shaded corners, arguments unfold. Near the Stoa Poikile, philosophers and statesmen debate questions that will shape generations.\nPeople come not only to trade goods, but to trade ideas. A young man listens, then speaks. A former student leaves convinced of something different than when he arrived. Convictions form here through exposure, challenge, imitation, and resistance.\nThis is not unique to Athens.\nAcross time and place, similar social mechanisms reappear. In Rome, the Forum combined politics and persuasion. In medieval monasteries, convictions were stabilized through repetition, copying, and disciplined interpretation. The printing press amplified these processes, extending influence beyond immediate presence. Coffeehouses and salons created dense networks of exchange. Universities of the Renaissance overturned inherited certainties. Streets and squares became sites where convictions were publicly contested and reshaped.\nWhat changes across these settings is scale and speed. What remains constant is the mechanism: convictions form through interaction.\nBut conviction formation is not limited to visible arenas of debate. It also occurs through routine, ritual, and repetition. A father reading the morning newspaper. A weekly conversation among friends. A community gathering around a shared text. These quiet, recurring practices stabilize convictions without argument, often without awareness.\nLater, digital networks introduced a new medium, not a new process. Online platforms accelerate exposure, intensify feedback, and allow conviction clusters to form rapidly. Yet the underlying dynamics remain familiar: repetition reinforces belief, social alignment increases confidence, and disagreement sharpens boundaries.\nConvictions are transmitted, tested, revised, and sometimes abandoned through these social processes. Rarely are they formed in isolation or by deliberate construction. More often, they emerge as byproducts of participation in shared practices and conversations.\nSeen this way, conviction formation is not primarily a matter of choice. It is a consequence of where we stand, who we listen to, how often we encounter certain ideas, and which responses are rewarded or resisted.\nIn this ever-changing landscape, our beliefs are less a product of deliberate choice than the natural byproduct of our lives. Like currents in a river, they emerge from the interplay of our experiences, our communities, and our unceasing dialogue with the world—shaped by obstacles, redirected by encounters, and sometimes forced into new paths.\nUnderstanding this shifts attention away from individual belief as a private possession and toward conviction as a social process. One that operates continuously, whether we reflect on it or not.\nHow Convictions Work\nConvictions Are Not Chosen, They Emerge\nConvictions shape how we think, decide, and act. But they are not chosen in the way we choose clothes or meals. We do not survey alternatives and select convictions at will. Instead, convictions emerge over time from the interplay of experience, social influence, and thinking.\nThis raises a basic question: what makes human conviction formation possible at all?\nLanguage: The Prerequisite for Convictions\nWithout language, could we have convictions in the human sense?\nAnimals act on expectations and learned patterns. A dog waits for its owner. A raven uses tools. These behaviors suggest something belief-like. But animals do not seem to reflect on their beliefs, question them, or revise them through discussion.\nHumans can. We can articulate what convinces us, challenge it, defend it, and reconsider it. Language makes this possible. It allows us to externalize thought, to compare perspectives, and to form convictions about convictions.\nThis capacity for meta-convictions, beliefs about how beliefs should be formed and evaluated, appears to be a defining feature of human conviction formation.\nHuman convictions are shaped and transformed through linguistic reflection and exchange.\nThe Three Pillars of Conviction Formation\nHuman convictions are shaped by three fundamental forces: experience, social reinforcement, and thinking.\nExperience provides direct contact with the world. Some lessons are immediate. Touching fire teaches that it burns. Most are not. Convictions often form through repetition, pattern recognition, and accumulated familiarity rather than single events. Skills, practices, and expectations are refined through ongoing interaction with reality.\nBut no one experiences everything firsthand.\nFrom birth onward, we are embedded in a social environment that shapes how experience is interpreted. Social reinforcement provides shared frameworks for understanding the world. Parents, teachers, peers, institutions, and cultures transmit assumptions about what is normal, reasonable, and valuable.\nMany convictions feel self-evident not because they are universal, but because they are shared. Encountering other cultures or historical periods often reveals how much of what we believe was absorbed rather than independently formed.\nSocial reinforcement also shapes how we learn to think. From early education onward, we are taught rule-based domains where correctness is clear and fixed. This can and often does foster an unnoticed conviction that all knowledge works this way, even though many important domains operate through judgment, interpretation, and revision rather than strict rules.\nThinking allows convictions to be tested, combined, weakened, or reinforced without direct action. Through questioning, imagination, abstraction, and reasoning, we explore alternatives and consequences. Justification plays a central role here, not only in persuading others, but in stabilizing our own convictions.\nThinking does not stand outside conviction formation. It is one of its arenas.\nMetaphors quietly guide this process. They structure how we understand unfamiliar domains by mapping them onto familiar ones. Because such metaphors are often implicit, they shape conviction formation without drawing attention to themselves.\nConvictions Hold Us\nConvictions relate to us much like a skeleton relates to the body.\nThey enable movement and at the same time restrict it. Without a skeleton, we would collapse. Without convictions, we could not navigate life in a coherent way. But just as a skeleton limits how we can move, convictions set boundaries on what we consider possible, reasonable, or acceptable.\nWe do not choose our skeleton, and we cannot replace it overnight. It grows with us and adapts gradually. Convictions work similarly. They strengthen or weaken through reflection, learning, and exposure, but they do not change arbitrarily or instantly.\nWe inherit biological conditions, grow up in specific social environments, and are shaped by historical circumstances. Conviction formation is the result of this process, not a detached act of choice.\nThis, in essence, is what Conviction Formation Theory describes.\nWe do not function without a conviction structure, just as we cannot move without a skeleton. Removing all convictions would not lead to freedom or neutrality. It would undermine the conditions that make self and agency possible: the ability to act, to judge, to commit, and to take responsibility for what one does.\nThe Connection Between Authenticity And Convictions\nConvictions do not only guide action. They also shape how a person experiences themselves.\nMany people go through periods of feeling lost: unsure of what they believe, what they want, or who they are becoming. This often coincides with instability in their conviction structure. Beliefs are adopted, tested, abandoned, and replaced in quick succession, without settling into a coherent whole.\nThis is not simply indecision. It can reflect a lack of alignment between a person and the convictions they are trying to live by.\nConvictions continue to change over time, but change alone is not the issue. What matters is coherence. A conviction structure that fits the person who holds it provides orientation, even when it remains open to revision. When convictions and lived experience pull in different directions, the result is often a sense of inauthenticity or self-betrayal.\nFrom this perspective, authenticity is not about discovering timeless truths about oneself. It is about inhabiting a conviction structure that is livable for the person one is, here and now. A structure that allows action without constant self-friction.\nTruth-framing often obscures this. When convictions are evaluated primarily against an external, supposedly objective standard, personal misalignment is easily misinterpreted as error rather than mismatch. One can meet widely accepted criteria of success or correctness and still experience profound dissatisfaction, because the convictions guiding those choices do not fit the person living under them.\nThis becomes especially visible in questions of value. If values are expected to carry weight only by being objectively true, their failure to meet that standard can lead to the conclusion that they are arbitrary. But this conclusion depends on the assumption that truth is the only source of normative force.\nConviction Formation Theory suggests otherwise. It treats convictions as evolving alignments between experience, social context, and reflection. From this view, authenticity is not the result of justification by external standards, but of coherence between what one is convinced of and how one lives.\nTruth-framing itself is not exempt from this analysis. It, too, is sustained by convictions that were not justified by the standards they impose on others.\nHow To Work With Convictions\nConvictions form through experience, social reinforcement, and thinking. They are not voluntary; we do not simply pick them like items off a shelf. They take shape over time, shaped by our encounters, our upbringing, and the ways we justify what convinces us.\nOnce formed, convictions do not exist in isolation. They tend to cluster, reinforce one another, or come into tension. Some stabilize a broader structure; others strain against it until something gives. Convictions can also weaken over time when they are no longer supported by experience, practice, or reflection.\nThis raises a natural question: what can we do when we suspect that some of our convictions no longer serve us well, or no longer fit who we are becoming?\nWorking with convictions does not mean choosing them freely. It means relating to them deliberately. Conviction formation has its own dynamics, but those dynamics are not beyond influence.\nA useful way to think about this is cultivation. Convictions, like plants, have a life of their own, but they grow within an environment that can be shaped. Some reinforce one another and support a stable whole. Others crowd out alternatives or create internal conflict. Some take root without being noticed and persist simply because nothing has challenged them.\nThe aim of cultivation is not uniformity or control, but sustainability. A conviction structure is healthy when it supports orientation, action, and responsibility for the person who lives within it.\nThe most important prerequisite for this kind of work is the ability to ask the right questions.\nQuestions: The Engine Of Conviction Formation\nQuestions arise from the finiteness of thought. We cannot grasp everything at once. Our attention is limited, our working memory constrained. Thinking proceeds by focusing on fragments, shifting perspective, and connecting elements step by step.\nThis is not merely a limitation. It is the basic structure of thought itself. It enables understanding while at the same time setting its boundaries. We saw this earlier in the skeleton analogy: structure makes movement possible, but never unlimited.\nLanguage reflects this finiteness. Every sentence has a subject, a verb, a structure. It must say this rather than everything. No sentence can exhaust its topic. Something is always left open, requiring further clarification, extension, or revision.\nEven in mathematics and formal logic, where rigor is highest, this remains true. Infinite objects are handled through finite definitions. Proofs must be finite to function as proofs at all. Thought advances not by total capture, but by controlled steps.\nQuestions emerge precisely at the points where this finiteness becomes visible. They mark gaps in our understanding, not as vague absences, but as specific openings. A question is a structured invitation to continue thinking at a particular place, in a particular direction.\nThis is why we say that a statement \"raises a question\". The sentence incurs a kind of debt. The question names what remains unresolved and directs attention toward it, allowing thinking to proceed without collapsing under what is unknown.\nConvictions provide stability. Questions provide movement.\nTogether, they form a dynamic system. Convictions determine which questions can be asked meaningfully. Questions, in turn, reorganize convictions by testing, refining, or displacing them.\nIn this sense, questions are not merely tools for acquiring information. They are the primary mechanism by which conviction structures change over time.\nQuestions And Convictions\nQuestions and convictions are not opposites. They are deeply intertwined.\nConvictions provide stability and orientation. Questions provide movement. Without questions, convictions would stagnate. Without convictions, questions would have no place to begin or to land.\nLearning which questions are worth pursuing, and how to ask them well, is not a matter of following rules. It develops through experience, social reinforcement, and reflection, just like convictions themselves. Over time, we also form meta-questions: questions about why we are asking what we are asking, and what assumptions guide our inquiry.\nIn this way, questions are the dynamic counterpart of convictions. They test, refine, reorganize, and sometimes replace what we are convinced of. Convictions, in turn, shape which questions make sense to ask at all.\nThis interplay is not incidental. It is how thinking advances under finite conditions.\nConvictions hold us.\nQuestions move us.\nTogether, they make thought possible.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-i/03-the-mechanics-of-conviction-formation/","title":"3.

How did it get so pervasive, and why is it broken even though everybody pretends it's not?\nThe next chapters trace the making and unraveling of truth. Not as a neutral history, but as a story of recurring collapses. For centuries, truth was seen as something stable, a foundation on which knowledge could stand. But as thinkers pushed deeper, cracks formed. Each attempt to justify truth only made the ground beneath it less secure.\nThe philosophers in this chapter did not seek to destroy truth. They were trying to clarify and save it. Yet, one by one, they dismantled its foundation, often without intending to. What began as a project of securing certainty ended with its collapse. And once certainty was gone, the very idea of truth was on the line.\nThis collapse did not happen all at once. It unfolded in stages. And to understand how we arrived at the need for Conviction Formation Theory, we must follow the path of those who first tried to hold truth together.\nRené Descartes stands out for a claim as bold as the Montgolfier brothers' dream of defying gravity, something once thought reserved for birds and angels.\nHe claimed that absolute certainty was possible. Not by avoiding doubt, but by using it as a tool.\nHe turned away from external sources of knowledge and looked inward, convinced that truth must be built on something undeniable, a foundation that could not be shaken.\nBefore Descartes, truth was often distinguished from non-truth through appeal to authority, tradition, or divine order, whether in Aristotelian metaphysics, Scholastic reasoning, or religious revelation. There was a mainstream background of truth that was not doubted. After Descartes, truth had to be reconstructed from first principles, from the ground up, proved foundations.\nHis revolution forced all later thinkers to take a stand on this problem.\nDescartes: The Search For A Certain Foundation\nPhilosophy did not begin with René Descartes, but modern philosophy did.\nThinkers before him had debated truth, knowledge, and certainty for centuries, but Descartes did something different: he changed the very method of philosophy itself. He set it on a new trajectory, one that all later thinkers would either follow or resist.\nTo understand what he did, we do not need to retrace every step that led to him. The history is rich, and much can be learned from it. But we need only to see what he saw: the fragile ground on which truth was standing, and the foundation he believed he could build in its place.\nWhen Descartes set out to rebuild philosophy, the world was still shaped by the convictions of Scholasticism.\nScholasticism was an intricate system in which truth was anchored in authority: the authority of the Bible, the Church Fathers, and Aristotle, with his logic and categories. Knowledge was seen as hierarchical, passed down through authoritative texts, and aligned with a divinely ordered universe. The senses were trusted in everyday life, but ultimate certainty rested in the rational structure of the cosmos, overseen by God.\nYet Descartes stood at the threshold of modernity. Copernicus had displaced the Earth from the center of the cosmos. Galileo had defied church doctrine with his telescope. Skepticism was beginning to seep into intellectual life.\nDescartes thought this patchwork of convictions demanded a response. It needed a new foundation. Instead of treating uncertainty as a problem to be minimized, he made it his method. He would systematically doubt everything that could be doubted, stripping away assumptions until only what was truly certain remained. To avoid being misled by reason itself, he would consider only ideas that were clear and distinct. This, he believed, would reveal knowledge beyond question and allow him to distinguish truth from non-truth.\nOnce these indubitable foundations were set, logic alone would suffice to build the cathedral of certainty upon them.\nA prolific mathematician himself, Descartes found his model in the mathematics of his time. Unlike the shifting debates of philosophy or the uncertainties of the empirical sciences, mathematics proceeded step by step from simple, self-evident truths to complex conclusions. He believed that all knowledge could be structured in this way.\nIn his Discourse on Method, he wrote:\n\"I was particularly fond of mathematics, because of the certainty and\nthe self-evidence of its reasoning; but I did not yet understand its true use;\nand, thinking that it served only the mechanical arts, I was astonished that\ngiven that its foundations were so firm and solid, nothing more\nelevated had been built upon them[.]\"\n[\"Je me plaisais surtout aux mathématiques, à cause de la certitude et de\nl'évidence de leurs raisons: mais je ne remarquais point encore leur vrai usage;\net, pensant qu'elles ne servaient qu'aux arts mécaniques, je m'étonnais de ce que\nleurs fondements étant si fermes et si solides, on n'avait rien bâti dessus de plus\nrelevé[.]\"]\nTo bring this cathedral to life, Descartes turned inward. In a radical act of doubt, he dismantled every conviction he could. He imagined that the senses might deceive, that dreams might blur into waking life, that everything might be an illusion produced by a powerful demon. What, then, could withstand such skepticism?\nOnly this: that while doubting, he was still thinking. And if he was thinking, he must exist. Cogito, ergo sum. I think, therefore I am.\nThis was his first clear and distinct certainty, the first foothold on which truth could be rebuilt. Nothing was yet secured except this: that he was thinking, that he existed as a thinking being.\nWithin his thoughts, Descartes then claimed to find a clear and distinct idea of God. But, he argued, such an idea could not have originated from him. He was finite and imperfect, yet the idea of God was infinite and perfect. If the idea were his own creation, it would be limited like him. Only a perfect being could be the source of the idea of perfection itself. Therefore, God must exist.\nAnd since God is good, which is part of the very idea of God as a perfect being, God does not deceive us. We may err when we judge matters we do not yet understand clearly, but we have been given intellect by a good God. If we attend carefully to clear and distinct ideas, truth is within reach.\nIn this way, Descartes continued an older conviction, that divine order underlies reality. But the role of God had shifted. God was no longer the starting point of knowledge. He had become its guarantor. Descartes was certain that God exists for the reasons he had given, and because God is good, God could not be a deceiver.\nHis system attempted to give a rational underpinning to a familiar idea of truth: that what we say and think, when it is true, corresponds to something in the world. God, in Descartes' system, guarantees exactly this correspondence. He believed he had opened the door to secure knowledge, grounding the certainty of mathematics in something even more certain.\nViewed through the lens of conviction formation, Descartes seems to have believed that once his ideas were clearly explained and properly understood, they would naturally become convictions for anyone who grasped them. This assumption was tied to his belief in innate ideas, or one might say innate convictions. Certain fundamental truths, such as the existence of God or the nature of the self, were already embedded in human reason. If reason operated universally and without distortion, then clear and distinct truths would compel conviction in all rational minds.\nIf Descartes had lived to see the foundational crisis of mathematics in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries, would he still have trusted clarity and distinctness as the ultimate guides to truth? Or would he have turned his doubt back on the very method that had anchored his philosophy? Given the brilliance and seriousness of his mind, it is hard to imagine that he would not have reconsidered.\nHe cannot do so anymore. But we are still living in Descartes' wake.\nHis conviction that truth must be justified by reason alone remains one of the great shifts in intellectual history. He helped liberate the individual thinker from inherited truth, placing the responsibility for knowledge not in tradition, but in personal reason and reflection. Convictions that cannot be justified in this way come to seem suspect, or at least diminished.\nDescartes built a cathedral. But soon, a man named John Locke would begin to question whether some of its building material was viable at all.\nConviction Shift: Descartes\nDescartes shifted the justification of truth from external authority to individual reason. He sought certainty through methodical doubt, beginning with \"I think, therefore I am,\" and attempted to reconstruct knowledge step by step. The existence of God, understood as an innate idea, was meant to guarantee that clear and distinct ideas correspond to reality.\nBut this reliance on innate ideas opened a new line of doubt: What if clarity and distinctness are not enough? And what if the foundation itself turns out to be less secure than it appears?\nLocke: Knowledge Through Experience, Not Innate Ideas\nWhen Descartes sought certainty, he looked inward, turning to the clarity of reason. He believed truth had to be grasped through pure thought, secured by self-evident, indubitable principles alone. John Locke took a different path. Instead of starting with reason, he started with the world.\nBorn into an England shaped by civil war, religious upheaval, and scientific discovery, Locke lived in a time when authority was being questioned in every domain. Political power was no longer assumed to be divinely ordained, but challenged and debated. The disintegration of the old order was on full display. The foundations of knowledge were cracking even more visibly than in Descartes' time.\nLike Descartes, Locke accepted the certainty of mathematical truths and the idea that certainty mattered for how truth itself was conceived.\nLocke, however, claimed that the mind begins as a blank slate, a tabula rasa. We are not born with innate ideas already inscribed within us. All knowledge comes from experience.\nThis was a direct rejection of René Descartes. If ideas were truly innate, Locke reasoned, they would appear in everyone, regardless of culture, upbringing, or education. But they do not. The truths we take to be self-evident are, in fact, learned.\nPut in modern terms: if the idea of God as the highest being were truly clear, distinct, and innate, how is it that neither Gautama Buddha nor any of his followers arrived at it through meditation?\nFor Locke, experience was the source of all knowledge. Experience unfolded through two faculties working together: sensation and reflection. Sensation provided direct contact with the world. Reflection allowed the mind to process, compare, and analyze what had been gathered. Knowledge took shape through their interaction. Nothing was present before experience. It emerged from it.\nWhere Descartes had sought certainty through innate ideas, Locke sought it through reflection as part of experience. Reflection does not precede experience. It begins with it and builds ideas stone by stone. It may become a cathedral for one mind, and a straw hut for another.\nThis is not innate knowledge. Innate knowledge, if it existed, would be present in the mind from birth. Locke denied that such knowledge exists. There are no ideas that appear fully formed without experience.\nInstead, knowledge is acquired through reflection on ideas first supplied by sensation. Once we have encountered the color white through experience, we can reason about it independently. We do not need to inspect countless white objects to know that whatever is white is indeed white.\nThis is intuitive knowledge, and it is certain. It is true because the mind perceives the agreement or disagreement between ideas directly, without returning to the world for further confirmation.\nA second form of certain knowledge is demonstrative knowledge. Here the mind does not grasp truth immediately, as with intuitive knowledge, but arrives at it through a sequence of clear and connected steps.\nKnowledge of empirical objects, however, can never reach certainty. All we receive from objects are the sensations they produce in us. For Locke, probability is the highest standard attainable in this domain.\nNo indubitable idea proves that I exist as a thinking being. No innate idea proves that God exists. And if God's existence is uncertain, then God cannot serve as a guarantor that our perceptions match the world they purport to describe. For Locke, knowledge of external objects is excluded from certainty altogether.\nThis marks a decisive shift from Descartes. A whole domain of knowledge falls from certainty into probability.\nThe consequences reach into theories of truth. Correspondence between ideas can be judged directly by the mind, allowing certainty in logic and mathematics, much as Descartes had believed. But correspondence between ideas and external objects is never directly accessible. When truth concerns the external world, it is always approximate.\nIn An Essay Concerning Human Understanding, Locke distances himself explicitly from the Cartesian model of justification when he writes:\n\"For where is the man that has incontestable evidence of the truth of all that he holds, or of the falsehood of all he condemns; or can say that he has examined to the bottom all his own, or other men's opinions? The necessity of believing without knowledge, nay often upon very slight grounds, in this fleeting state of action and blindness we are in, should make us more busy and careful to inform ourselves than constrain others.\"\nBelieving without perfect knowledge, and without having examined all relevant grounds, is a condition of human life. It calls for careful inquiry rather than dogmatic certainty.\nAt the same time, truth remained Locke's guiding orientation. In a letter to his friend Anthony Collins, he writes: \"To love truth for truth's sake is the principal part of human perfection in this world, and the seed-plot of all other virtues.\"\nUnlike Descartes, who aimed to secure knowledge on an indubitable foundation, Locke accepted that most of what we believe is neither simply true nor simply false. It occupies a middle ground. What matters is how well it withstands experience and reflection.\nConvictions were therefore provisional. Always open to revision, correction, and refinement. Locke recognized that people often hold beliefs with absolute confidence despite lacking absolute proof. Rather than treating this as a defect, he treated it as a basic feature of human cognition. Truth was not something to be possessed, but something to be pursued.\nLocke's ideas reshaped not only philosophy, but also science, education, and politics. His arguments for natural rights and government by consent influenced the development of modern democratic thought. The framers of the U.S. Constitution drew heavily on his claim that legitimate political authority arises from the people rather than divine mandate. His emphasis on experience over innate reasoning laid the groundwork for empirical science, where knowledge is expected to be tested, revised, and updated. Education, in turn, shifted toward observation, reasoning, and exploration rather than passive transmission.\nWith Locke, the dream of an absolutely certain system gave way to something more grounded. Truth became less a destination than a path, especially when it concerned the objects of experience.\nBut even this more restrained vision would not remain intact. David Hume would push Locke's framework to its breaking point.\nConviction Shift: Locke\nLocke rejected Descartes' appeal to innate ideas and argued that knowledge begins with experience, shaped through sensation and reflection. Certainty remained possible in logic and mathematics, where relations between ideas could be grasped directly. But knowledge of the external world was irreducibly probable, always subject to revision. Truth became a pursuit rather than a possession, and conviction a stance held under conditions of uncertainty.\nHume: The Collapse Of Certainty\nIf Locke had argued that convictions emerge from experience, David Hume pushed that idea to its breaking point. Locke's system rested on assumptions he had not fully examined.\nHume took Locke's empiricism seriously. Perhaps more seriously than Locke himself had dared. If all knowledge comes from experience, then we must examine what experience actually gives us. And, as Hume showed, it gives us far less than we tend to assume.\nWe naturally suppose that objects persist even when we are not observing them. The tree outside my window today is the same tree it was yesterday, an object that maintains identity through time and change.\nHume challenges this assumption in his A Treatise of Human Nature:\n\"But this conclusion beyond the impressions of our senses can be founded only on the connexion of&nbsp;cause and effect; nor can we otherwise have any security, that the object is not chang'd upon us, however much the new object may resemble that which was formerly present to the senses.\"\nWhat Hume draws attention to is that common sense, and our ordinary talk about the world, rests on the assumption of a closed causal order. We assume that nothing changes without a cause.\nHume points out that we cannot even observe causation in individual cases. We see one event followed by another: a flame touches paper, the paper ignites. But the force that supposedly links them is never visible.\nFrom this, Hume concludes that what we call causation is nothing more than constant conjunction, the repeated association of one kind of event with another. We never observe a necessary connection. We observe patterns, and from these patterns we form expectations. Through habit, the mind comes to expect one event after another, and we mistake this expectation for necessity. There is no logical requirement that the sun must rise tomorrow. There is only our belief that it will, grounded in past regularities.\nThis line of thought extends further. If causation lacks necessity, then everything that depends on it becomes unstable. Is the tree outside the same tree as yesterday? We believe so, but that belief rests on habit, not necessity. The self fares no better. We think of ourselves as unified and continuous beings, but when Hume examined his own mind, he found only a succession of fleeting perceptions, sensations, and thoughts. Never a stable, enduring self. The belief in personal identity is, once again, a conviction formed by habit rather than reflection. Even the belief that things exist independently of us is known only through the effects they have on our senses.\nWhat remains secure are the demonstrative sciences: arithmetic and algebra. Hume acknowledges their certainty, but only in a limited sense. He writes in Book I of the Treatise:\n\"In all demonstrative sciences the rules are certain and infallible; but when we apply them, our fallible and uncertain faculties are very apt to depart from them, and fall into error.\"\nTo address this, he adds:\n\"We must, therefore, in every reasoning form a new judgment, as a check or controul on our first judgment or belief; and must enlarge our view to comprehend a kind of history of all the instances, wherein our understanding has deceiv'd us, compar'd with those, wherein its testimony was just and true.\"\nAnd he concludes:\n\"Our reason must be consider'd as a kind of cause, of which truth is the natural effect; but such-a-one as by the irruption of other causes, and by the inconstancy of our mental powers, may frequently be prevented. By this means all knowledge degenerates into probability.\"\nA familiar picture of truth is still present here. Reason aims at correspondence with reality. Truth is the natural effect of correct reasoning. But reason is an unreliable cause, constantly disrupted by other influences. Even the demonstrative sciences are vulnerable in their application. Certainty erodes from within.\nAt this point, certainty collapses entirely. Truth becomes a fragile and rare byproduct of reasoning. How far this is from where René Descartes began.\nThe Treatise of Human Nature strikes a distinctly heavy-hearted tone:\n\"When I turn my eye inward, I find nothing but doubt and ignorance. [...] For&nbsp;with what confidence can I venture upon such bold enterprizes, when beside those numberless infirmities peculiar to myself, I find so many which are common to human nature? Can I be sure, that in leaving all establish'd opinions I am following truth; and by what criterion shall I distinguish her, even if fortune shou'd at last guide me on her foot-steps? [... U]nderstanding, when it acts alone, and according to its most general principles, entirely subverts itself, and leaves not the lowest degree of evidence in any proposition, either in philosophy or&nbsp;common life.\"\nYet Hume was not a nihilist. The conclusion of Book I does not recommend abandoning belief. It recommends recognizing belief for what it is: a practical necessity rather than a logical achievement. Despite his skepticism, Hume still ate, trusted that food would nourish him, and expected the world to remain stable enough to play back-gammon. His philosophy was not a denial of reality, but an acknowledgment that human life cannot wait for absolute proof before it acts. Skepticism, he suggested, is not a way to live.\nThis may be the deepest lesson of conviction formation. We do not hold beliefs because they are proven beyond doubt, but because life requires us to. Philosophy, by demanding absolute certainty, may have set a trap for itself.\nHume's skepticism sent shockwaves through philosophy. If he was right, then no belief was ever fully justified, only assumed. Locke's world of measured inquiry became precarious. Descartes' cathedral of certainty collapsed. The search for an indubitable foundation had not led to solid ground, but to emptiness. What had passed for certainty now appeared as a lack of deeper doubt.\nHume's conclusions would strike Immanuel Kant with full force, provoking a response that aimed to rescue a refined version of correspondence and necessity by turning the entire picture upside down.\nConviction Shift: Hume\nHume carried empiricism to its limits. What we call knowledge, he argued, is not grounded in certainty but in habit. Mathematics retains certainty in its internal relations, but beyond that, inquiry resembles casting a line into murky water, hoping to catch something more substantial than driftwood. With Hume, certainty dissolves, leaving probability, and the recognition that conviction persists not because it is proven, but because life cannot proceed without it.\nRecap: The Collapse of Certainty\nCertainty feels good. When nothing stirs our doubts, when no counterarguments take hold, we feel grounded. We feel sure.\nRené Descartes wanted to use this feeling of certainty as a foundation for knowledge. What appeared undeniable to him at the end of his methodical doubt, he took to be universally undeniable, for all people, at all times. He had doubted as far as he knew how, and what remained seemed immovable.\nHe assumed that such certainty must correspond to the world, that it must be truth. His innate idea of God was meant to guarantee this correspondence.\nJohn Locke questioned Descartes' foundation, but not the overall project. He rejected innate ideas, began with a blank slate, and relied on experience and reflection to recover as much certainty as human knowledge would allow.\nDavid Hume took Locke's empiricism seriously, and followed it without restraint. In doing so, he discovered that much of what is called knowledge rests not on reason or necessity, but on custom and habit.\nCertainty rose, and then collapsed under its own weight.\nYet truth did not lose its pull. The desire for something unshakable remained.\nImmanuel Kant would take up this problem with a remarkable turn.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-ii/04-tracing-truth-certainty-and-its-collapse/","title":"4. Tracing Truth: Certainty And Its Collapse"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-ii/05-tracing-truth-the-rise-of-necessity/":{"body":"Kant: The Mind That Shapes Reality\nIntuitive certainty as a rational foundation for truth had collapsed spectacularly.\nIt is easy to gloss over this collapse from a distance. A few obscure thinkers pursued strange ideas about truth and failed to ground it securely. So what?\nBut these were not obscure thinkers. They were the most respected minds of their time. And their ideas about truth were not strange. On the contrary, they were natural starting points, reasonable attempts to anchor knowledge in clarity, experience, or reason.\nWhat had happened was this: in the dialogue of the best minds over a little more than a century, it became clear that the very concept of truth used in everyday life could not be justified. It could not be reconstructed in a way that held together.\nWorse still, the evidence pointed to something more radical. Our ordinary understanding of the world, with stable objects and necessary causal connections, appeared to rest not on reason or necessity, but on custom and habit.\nWhat could possibly help now?\nOnly one candidate for certainty seemed to remain: the step-by-step necessity of mathematics, what David Hume had called the demonstrative sciences.\nBut this route was treacherous. As Hume himself admitted, even if the rules of logic are infallible, our minds are not. We often fail to apply them correctly. We fall into error.\nStill, this was the only path left.\nSo Immanuel Kant turned away from intuitive certainty and toward demonstrative necessity.\nThis shift helps explain why Kant and the thinkers who followed him became famously difficult to read. The age of elegance and immediacy was over. With Kant, philosophy moved into abstraction, not out of arrogance, but because the problem demanded it.\nWhen Kant read Hume, he later wrote that it shook him from his dogmatic slumber. Hume had exposed the fragility of knowledge. If all we have are patterns of experience, then causation, the self, space, time, identity, even external reality itself become uncertain. But Kant saw a deeper puzzle behind Hume's skepticism.\nConsider causality. Kant agreed with Hume that causality involves necessity and universality. And he agreed that neither the relation of cause and effect nor the necessity of this connection can be found in what the senses give us.\nIn the Critique of Pure Reason, Kant writes:\n\"Experience never gives its judgments true or strict, but merely assumed or comparative&nbsp;universality&nbsp;[...] so that, properly speaking, it must be stated: so far as we have observed thus far, no exception has been found to this or that rule.\"\n[\"Erfahrung gibt niemals ihren Urteilen wahre oder strenge,\nsondern nur angenommene und komparative Allgemeinheit [...], so daß es eigentlich heißen muß: soviel wir bisher\nwahrgenommen haben, findet sich von dieser oder jener Regel keine\nAusnahme.\"]\nYet we do not merely expect causality. We rely on it as if it were necessary: everything has a cause, nothing happens without one. Today, we can at least imagine genuinely random processes, such as the decay of radioactive elements, for which no hidden causes appear to exist. But in Kant’s time, such possibilities lay entirely outside the horizon of thought.\nKant therefore argues against Hume:\n\"[...] the very concept of cause so obviously contains the concept of a necessity of the connection with an effect and a strict universality of the rule, that the concept would be entirely lost if one were to derive it, as Hume did, from a frequent association [...].\"\n[\"[...] ja in dem\nletzteren enthält selbst der Begriff einer Ursache so offenbar den\nBegriff einer Notwendigkeit der Verknüpfung mit einer Wirkung und\neiner strengen Allgemeinheit der Regel, daß er gänzlich verlorengehen\nwürde, wenn man ihn, wie Hume tat, von einer öftern Beigesellung\ndessen, was geschieht, mit dem, was vorhergeht, und einer daraus\nentspringenden Gewohnheit, [...]\nVorstellungen zu verknüpfen, ableiten wollte.\"]\nKant concludes: \"If, therefore, a judgment is thought in strict universality, i.e., so that no exception at all is allowed to be possible, then it is not derived from experience [...].\"\n[\"Wird also ein Urteil in strenger Allgemeinheit gedacht, d.i.\nso, daß gar keine Ausnahme als möglich verstattet wird, so ist es\nnicht von der Erfahrung abgeleitet [...].\"]\nSolving this puzzle, Kant suspected, required a new kind of judgment.\nKant's predecessors had assumed that all knowledge fell into two categories. First, statements that are true or false solely by virtue of the concepts involved, independent of experience, such as \"a bachelor is unmarried.\" Second, statements whose truth cannot be determined by concepts alone and must therefore be learned from experience, such as \"wood is hard.\"\nKant argued that this division was incomplete. There is a third category: statements whose truth is not revealed by conceptual analysis alone, yet which cannot be derived from experience either, such as 7 + 5 = 12.\nIf such judgments exist, then Hume may have dismissed too much. And perhaps something could still be saved.\nKant's investigation begins with a striking claim. Strip away all perception of objects and all thoughts about them, and something still remains: space and time. These, he argues, are not learned from experience. They are the necessary preconditions for having any experience at all.\nCausality is another such necessary precondition. Personal identity, too, depends on structural features of cognition rather than experience alone.\nFrom this Kant draws a new conclusion about truth. Truth does not arise solely from what the world gives us. It depends on how our minds are structured to receive it. The mind is not a passive observer. It actively shapes experience. In order for experience to be possible at all, the mind must already supply its basic form.\nOur minds therefore organize sensory input according to built-in structures: space and time, and a set of fundamental categories such as cause, substance, and identity. These structures are not learned. They are innate structures, though not innate ideas in the Cartesian sense.\nWhen we judge something to be true, we are not simply matching thoughts to a raw, independent world. We are recognizing that a judgment fits the world as it appears through this shared cognitive framework.\nThis was Kant's central move. He made the conditions for experience and knowledge internal to the mind, without collapsing into subjectivism. These conditions are not private. They are necessary for any possible experience at all. Truth still means correspondence with reality, but a reality already structured by the mind. We see the world through categories we cannot not use.\nNaive truth is preserved, and so are causality, the self, space, time, and identity. But the price is clear. Truth now applies only to the world as it appears to us. The world as it is in itself remains inaccessible. The mind both enables knowledge and limits it.\nKant also drew boundaries for philosophy. Philosophy as pure speculation, he argued, overreaches, because it lacks a criterion for its truth. Philosophy can only proceed legitimately by identifying the necessary conditions of possible experience.\nThe impact of this insight was immense. It reshaped epistemology and altered how science, psychology, and the limits of reason itself were understood.\nKant had rebuilt certainty. Not as something felt, but as something structured: necessity. He had shown that we must experience the world in certain ways if we are to experience it at all. And that truth is shaped by those conditions.\nBut the cost remained. The world before us was appearance. The world in itself unfolded behind our backs, forever beyond direct reach.\nRené Descartes had imagined truth as a cathedral built from ideas, resting on certainty.\nJohn Locke had objected that it must be built from experience, stone by stone, from a blank slate.\nKant returned to the cathedral. But now it was not made of ideas. It was made of the mind's own structure.\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel would resist this. He would argue that even the structure of thought unfolds over time. That the mind is not a cathedral, but the becoming of a cathedral.\nMuch later, science would raise its hand. Charles Darwin would challenge the assumption that cognitive structures are fixed. And relativity theory would bind space and time into a single fabric, spacetime, a structure that disappears if all matter disappears. If space and time were necessary forms of human experience, how could they vanish?\nConviction Shift: Kant\nKant gave up on intuitive certainty and asked instead: what are the necessary conditions for experience? From these conditions he concluded that we do not merely receive the world. We actively shape it. Space, time, causality, and identity are not learned, but are required for any experience to occur at all. Truth survives, but only within the world of appearance. The world as it is in itself remains out of reach.\nHegel: Truth As The Whole\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel thought Kant's account was lopsided.\nTo Hegel, mind and object cannot be cleanly separated. They are not two independent things that somehow have to be connected afterward. They belong to one evolving whole. Otherwise, how could the mind ever reach the object at all?\nThe mind also does not begin already equipped with a fixed set of categories. It begins as a largely undifferentiated, receptive presence to what appears. Not yet structured understanding, but the seed from which structure will grow. The categories Kant treated as conditions of experience are, for Hegel, results of a developmental process, not its starting point.\nThat initial presence soon encounters something that does not fit. Something that contradicts its first grasp of the world. To resolve this tension, the mind adjusts and expands. In doing so, it does not discard what came before. It preserves it while transforming it.\nContradiction by contradiction, the mind advances toward a more adequate understanding.\nTruth, for Hegel, is not a fixed correspondence discovered at a single moment. It is the unfolding whole. It emerges only at the end of the mind's journey, after every contradiction has been confronted and integrated. One stage at a time: a position, its contradiction, a higher reconciliation. The seed becomes the flower.\nThis process is already visible at the very beginning of his Phenomenology of Spirit, where consciousness is still minimally articulated. Hegel introduces the example of the \"Here\":\n\"The Here is for example the tree. I turn around, so this truth has disappeared, and has turned into its opposite truth: the Here is not a tree, but rather a house. The Here does not disappear; rather, it persists in the disappearance of the house, tree and so forth, and indifferent to being house or tree. The [Here] shows itself as mediated simplicity, or as generality.\"\n[\"Das Hier ist z.B. der Baum. Ich wende mich um, so ist diese Wahrheit verschwunden und hat sich in die entgegengesetzte verkehrt: Das Hier ist nicht ein Baum, sondern vielmehr ein Haus. Das Hier selbst verschwindet nicht; sondern es ist bleibend im Verschwinden des Hauses, Baumes usf. und gleichgültig, Haus, Baum zu sein. Das [Hier] zeigt sich also wieder als vermittelte Einfachheit oder als Allgemeinheit.\"]\nWhat is happening here should not be read as a trick of language, but a movement of consciousness itself. At first, the mind takes \"this\" to be a determinate object: the tree. Turning around reveals a contradiction: \"this\" is now a house, not a tree. The mind cannot simply discard one truth in favor of the other. It must revise its understanding. It comes to see that \"this\" is not a particular object at all, but a form of immediacy that can host different determinations.\nThe contradiction is not an error to be eliminated. It is the engine of development.\nThis process continues, stage by stage, as consciousness refines and expands its concepts, integrating ever more of reality into understanding. Philosophy, for Hegel, does not consist in identifying timeless conditions of experience, but in following experience as it transforms itself through its own internal tensions.\nHegel begins with something like Kant's receptive mind, but without Kant's fixed categories. That mind is already embedded in the world and develops in interaction with it. There is no sharp divide between appearance and an unknowable thing in itself. The mind does not merely impose form on reality. It develops itself to grasp reality more adequately. This was the asymmetry in Kant that Hegel wanted to overcome.\nWhen every contradiction has been integrated according to the inner necessity of the object, and no unresolved tensions remain, absolute knowledge is reached. At that point, mind and object coincide. Knowledge becomes fully true, not because it mirrors reality from outside, but because it has become adequate to it from within.\nHegel distinguishes between two kinds of necessity, and it matters which one is at work here.\nOuter necessity is formal necessity. The kind found in mathematical proofs, where each step follows according to rules applied from the outside. Such necessity is indifferent to the content of what is being proved.\nInner necessity, by contrast, is the necessity of the thing itself. It is the logic of the object's own development. Hegel's logic aims to trace this inner movement. It cannot be reduced to formal rules, because its direction is determined by the content it unfolds.\nCritics have long objected that this reduces necessity to whatever Hegel himself judges necessary.\nSome regard his philosophy as a milestone in the history of thought. Others see it as an elaborate illusion, a system that mistakes its own momentum for truth. No consensus has ever been reached.\nHegel himself believed that his system represented the culmination of philosophical development, the point at which thought finally became fully transparent to itself. An extraordinary act of intellectual self-congratulation.\nThe cost of this ambition was substantial. Hegel's system is vast, abstract, and often impenetrable. His writing is dense, his sentences winding, his conceptual machinery heavy. His vision of history as a progression toward higher forms of understanding can appear either emancipatory or oppressive. Does disagreement signal genuine difference, or merely developmental delay? Can entire cultures be ranked as more or less advanced? These questions would later take on unmistakably political significance.\nStill, Hegel's achievement remains singular. He offered the most ambitious attempt to understand not just truth, but the formation of truth itself. To show how convictions are not simply adopted or rejected, but formed through necessity.\nConvictions, for him, are neither imposed from outside nor chosen freely from within. They emerge in the tension between both. Contradiction is not failure, but fuel. Truth is not found by eliminating error, but by integrating it into a higher understanding.\nConvictions evolve through breakdown, revision, and reconciliation. And although Hegel believed this development to be universal and necessary, the lasting insight is more modest: what we believe depends on where we stand in an unfolding process.\nConviction is not static. It is lived history, one contradiction at a time. And what counts as a contradiction depends on deeper commitments: on what we take to be capable of conflict in the first place.\nArthur Schopenhauer, a contemporary of Hegel, belonged firmly to the camp that saw his system as illusion. He thought Kant did not need to be overcome, but clarified and completed. What Hegel presented as necessary development, Schopenhauer saw as projection: a grand narrative imposed on a world driven by blind will rather than rational unfolding.\nKarl Marx, by contrast, found something powerful in Hegel’s dialectic. He stripped it of its idealism and recast it as material struggle. History, on this view, is not driven by ideas realizing themselves, but by economic forces that generate ideas as their expression. Dialectic survived, but its subject changed.\nMuch later, science added a further complication. Some processes converge; others stall in local optima. Some models overfit their own internal structure and mistake that structure for reality. What looks like necessity from within a system may be an artifact of the system itself.\nConviction Shift: Hegel\nHegel rejected the idea that truth is fixed or given in advance. He denied that the mind begins with a complete set of categories, and instead understood truth as the unfolding of mind and reality together in a whole. Convictions arise through struggle, contradiction, and integration, driven by inner necessity rather than choice. When development reaches its completion, thought and reality coincide. Truth, for Hegel, is what emerges at the end of this dialectical journey.\nSchopenhauer: Truth As A Veil Over The Will\nArthur Schopenhauer saw himself as one of the last genuine philosophers, fighting against what he regarded as the intellectual fraudulence unleashed by Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel. To him, Hegel was not a brilliant system-builder, but a charlatan: a master of convoluted obscurity who had seduced academia with empty verbiage.\nFor Schopenhauer, Hegel's belief in historical progress, in the unfolding of ever-higher truths, was a grand illusion. Where Hegel saw dialectical development, Schopenhauer saw an endless cycle of blind striving and suffering.\nWhere Hegel saw ideas evolving toward truth, Schopenhauer saw ideas as surface-level rationalizations of deeper, irrational forces. Hegel's philosophy appeared to him as a magnificent distraction, a way for people to convince themselves that they were advancing toward wisdom, when in fact they were merely justifying the restless movement of the Will.\nAgainst Hegel, Schopenhauer believed that Immanuel Kant had been largely right. But Kant, in his view, had stopped one step too early.\nWe do, Schopenhauer claimed, have access to the thing in itself.\nIn the second book of The World as Will and Representation, he writes:\n\"If we in the first book [...] had explained our own body, like all other objects in this vivid world, as a mere representation of the cognizing subject;\"\n[\"Wenn wir im ersten Buche, [...] den eigenen Leib, wie alle übrigen Objekte dieser anschaulichen Welt, für bloße Vorstellung des erkennenden Subjekts erklärten;\"]\nLook at your hand. It appears as an object, structured by space, time, and causality. It is representation. Close one eye, then the other. The hand you see shifts position, but the hand itself does not.\nSchopenhauer continues:\n\"[T]hen now it has become clear to us, what in everyone's consciousness distinguishes the representation of the body from everything else, [...] namely this, that the body occurs in consciousness in a completely different way, different in kind altogether, which we designate by the word will, and that exactly this double cognition, that we have of our own body, gives us insight into itself, its action and movement on motifs, as well as its suffering through external influence, in one word, about what it is, not as a representation, but furthermore, in itself, which we do not have immediately of the nature, action and suffering of all other real objects.\"\n[\"[S]o ist es uns nunmehr\ndeutlich geworden, was im Bewußtseyn eines Jeden,\ndie Vorstellung des eigenen Leibes von allen andern,\ndieser übrigens ganz gleichen, unterscheidet, nämlich\ndies, daß der Leib noch in einer ganz andern, toto genere verschiedenen Art im Bewußtseyn vorkommt,\ndie man durch das Wort Wille bezeichnet, und daß\neben diese doppelte Erkenntniß, die wir vom eigenen\nLeibe haben, uns über ihn selbst, über sein Wirken\nund Bewegen auf Motive, wie auch über sein Leiden\ndurch äußere Einwirkung, mit Einem Wort, über das,\nwas er, nicht als Vorstellung, sondern außerdem, also\nan sich ist, denjenigen Aufschluß giebt, welchen wir\nüber das Wesen, Wirken und Leiden aller andern realen Objekte unmittelbar nicht haben.\"]\nPinch your hand. The pain you feel is not merely an appearance. It is not representation of something else. It is something more immediate. Here, Schopenhauer argues, we encounter the thing in itself directly: Will.\nThe Will manifests itself in all appearances. In gravity and magnetism. In the formation of crystals. In the growth of trees and their reproduction through fruit. Everywhere, the same blind force expresses itself.\nIt becomes most visible in life. Schopenhauer offers example after example:\n\"[T]he young spider [has no idea] of the prey for which it spins a web; nor has the ant-lion any idea of the ant for which it digs a trench for the first time. The larva of the stag-beetle bites the hole in the wood, in which it is to await its metamorphosis, twice as large if it is to become a male beetle as if it is to become a female, in the first case so that there may be room for the horns, of which it has no idea yet. In such actions of these animals the will is clearly operative as in their other actions; but it is in blind activity, which is admittedly accompanied by knowledge but not guided by it.\"\n[\"[D]ie junge Spinne [hat keine Vorstellung] von dem Raube, zu\ndem sie ein Netz wirkt; noch der Ameisenlöwe von\nder Ameise, der er zum ersten Male eine Grube gräbt;\ndie Larve des Hirschschröters beißt das Loch im\nHolze, wo sie ihre Verwandelung bestehn will, noch\nein Mal so groß, wenn sie ein männlicher, als wenn\nsie ein weiblicher Käfer werden will, im ersten Fall\num Platz für Hörner zu haben, von denen sie noch\nkeine Vorstellung hat. In solchem Thun dieser Thiere\nist doch offenbar, wie in ihrem übrigen Thun, der\nWille thätig; aber er ist in blinder Thätigkeit, die zwar\nvon Erkenntniß begleitet, aber nicht von ihr geleitet\nist.\"]\nAnd finally, the Will becomes conscious of itself in the human being.\nThe Will is free, because it is the thing in itself. But this freedom offers no comfort. You can do what you want, but you cannot want what you want.\nWhere Kant had argued that truth is shaped by the structures of cognition, Schopenhauer went deeper. Even our most rational insights, he claimed, are surface effects of a deeper, irrational force.\nWe believe not because we reason well, but because we are compelled. The intellect is not the master. It is the servant of the Will, producing explanations and justifications after the fact for what has already been decided at a deeper level.\nHuman life, on this view, is inherently tragic. We are caught in an endless cycle of desire and dissatisfaction. We strive, we obtain, and satisfaction vanishes almost immediately, replaced by new longing. The Will drives us forward without ever allowing rest.\nWhat we call happiness is merely a brief pause in suffering.\nThis stood in stark opposition to Enlightenment optimism. Reason and progress, Schopenhauer believed, could never free us from the tyranny of the Will. No amount of clarity dissolves blind striving. We are trapped in illusion and pain.\nYet Schopenhauer did not leave us entirely without escape. If truth and conviction are surface phenomena, then liberation cannot come from better beliefs. It must come from loosening the grip of the Will itself. Art, music, and contemplative absorption offer temporary relief, moments in which willing falls silent.\nBut lasting release, he argued, requires something more radical: renunciation. The denial of the Will's demands.\nSchopenhauer's fascination with Indian philosophy was no ornament. It shaped his entire outlook. In Buddhism and Vedanta he found confirmation of his own insight: that desire is the root of suffering, and that wisdom lies in withdrawal rather than affirmation. Where Western philosophy had sought salvation through reason, Schopenhauer believed peace could come only through detachment.\nSchopenhauer accepted Kant's verdict on naive truth theory: correspondence applies only within the world of appearance. But he took one further step. And one step deeper.\nHe claimed that we do have access to the thing in itself. It is blind Will, endlessly struggling with itself.\nWe do not merely suffer in the world. We suffer as the world.\nNaive truth returns. But what it reveals is not order or reason. It is striving without purpose.\nSchopenhauer's lasting contribution is not that he exposed illusion, but that he explained why even clarity can betray us. Something deeper uses the mind for its own ends.\nHis dark vision turned philosophy away from faith in rational necessity toward the irrational forces shaping belief, action, and suffering. His influence on Friedrich Nietzsche was profound. Nietzsche would first admire him, then rebel, taking Schopenhauer's insight and reversing its conclusion: not renunciation, but affirmation.\nSigmund Freud denied any influence from Schopenhauer. Few have found this denial convincing.\nConviction Shift: Schopenhauer\nSchopenhauer rejected the idea that reason leads directly to truth. Convictions, for him, are not shaped by logic alone, but by a deeper force he called the Will: blind, irrational striving beneath all appearances. The intellect serves this force, providing explanations after the fact. Conviction is not a triumph of insight, but an expression of inner compulsion. Truth-seeking becomes a veil over desire. Liberation, if it is possible at all, does not come from believing the right thing, but from loosening the grip of the Will.\nIn this sense, naive truth returns once more. But what it reveals beneath appearance is not harmony or reason. It is blind striving, endlessly repeating itself.\nMarx: Truth As Ideology\nThe Young Hegelians were a loose and quarrelsome circle of students and critics who believed that Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel had retreated into abstraction, leaving reality behind.\nOne of them, Ludwig Feuerbach, attacked Hegel's philosophy at its very starting point. In Towards a Critique of Hegel's Philosophy, he writes:\n\"'The here is a tree'; but I walk further and say: 'The here is a house.' The first truth has now disappeared. [...] We cannot even speak of the individual, which we mean in the sensuous certainty.\" - \"The here - why not that which is here?\"\n[\"'Das Hier ist ein Baum'; aber ich gehe\nweiter und sage: 'Das Hier ist ein Haus.' Die erste Wahrheit\nist verschwunden. [...] Das Einzelne, welches wir\nin der sinnlichen Gewißheit meinen, können wir daher gar\nnicht einmal aussprechen.\", \"Das Hier - warum nicht das Hierseiende?\"]\nFeuerbach's point was blunt. Hegel, he argued, loses real things at the very first step of his philosophy. Abstraction dissolves the concrete world instead of explaining it.\nHe later makes the same point with an almost mocking example:\n\"My brother is called John; but innumerable people besides him are called John too. Does it follow now that my brother John is not real? Or that Johnness is the truth?\"\n[\"Mein Bruder heißt Johann Adolph; aber außer ihm\nsind und heißen noch unzählige andere auch Johann Adolph.\nFolgt nun daraus, daß mein Johann keine Realität ist? folgt\ndaraus, daß die Johannheit eine Wahrheit ist?\"]\nFor Feuerbach, Hegel's method was not philosophy but a game with words. Real knowledge, he insisted, must begin from the sensuous, physical world.\nHe concludes that beginning from sensuous reality is the only justified starting point, because otherwise \"we would let ourselves be fobbed off with words instead of things\".\n[\"sonst würden wir\nuns im Leben statt mit Sachen mit Worten abspeisen lassen\"]\nThis position came to be known as materialism.\nBut Karl Marx thought even this was not radical enough.\nIn his Theses on Feuerbach, he writes:\n\"\"Feuerbach is not content with abstract thinking and wants intuition; but he does not grasp sensuousness as practical, human-sensuous activity.\"\n[\"Feuerbach, mit dem abstrakten Denken nicht zufrieden, will die Anschauung; aber er faßt die Sinnlichkeit nicht als praktische menschlich-sinnliche Tätigkeit.\"]\nFeuerbach, Marx thought, had taken only a half step. He had moved from abstract speculation to contemplative observation. But materialism, Marx argued, must go further. It must turn to practice.\nThat meant turning to economy: to the concrete ways in which real human beings organize their lives, labor, feed themselves, reproduce, and struggle within societies.\nMarx took Hegel's dialectical method and applied it not to concepts, but to historical forces of production.\nTruth, in this view, is not merely an individual achievement. It is shaped by material conditions. Convictions arise within social structures, formed by labor relations, ownership, class position, and struggle. Morality, politics, religion, and philosophy are not neutral reflections of reality. They are conditioned by the mode of production of a society.\nPhilosophy, Marx argued, had spent too long treating ideas as if they floated above human life. But convictions are not born in a vacuum. They emerge from lived roles within economic systems.\nHistory, therefore, does not move forward through the refinement of ideas, but through conflict. Each historical epoch has a dominant mode of production, like feudalism, capitalism, and so on, and with it, a dominant ideology. What appears \"natural,\" \"rational,\" or \"true\" in a given era reflects the interests embedded in that system. The feudal lord believed in divine hierarchy; the capitalist believes in free markets. Neither belief is timeless. Each is historically conditioned.\nWhere Hegel saw contradictions between ideas driving history forward, Marx saw contradictions between classes. The struggle is not conceptual but material. The synthesis is not a higher idea, but a new social order produced through conflict, upheaval, and transformation.\nLike Hegel, Marx believed history moved toward a final resolution. In his case, this would be a classless society, where material contradictions had been overcome. Only then, Marx believed, could human beings perceive reality without ideological distortion. Only then would truth no longer serve class interests. In this sense, naive truth theory would be restored — but only after history had done its work.\nThe implications were explosive. If truth itself is shaped by material conditions, then philosophy cannot limit itself to interpretation. It must intervene.\nMarx famously summarized this in the final thesis of the Theses on Feuerbach:\n\"The philosophers have only interpreted the world, in various ways; the point, however, is to change it.\"\nMarx added a new demand to the history of truth: truth must prove itself in history.\nMarx's influence did not end with his lifetime. The Soviet Union has collapsed, but Marxist ideas continue to shape political movements and academic discourse. China and North Korea still govern under explicitly communist frameworks, and critiques of capitalism drawing on Marx remain influential worldwide.\nConviction Shift: Marx\nMarx relocated truth from thought to material life. Convictions are not timeless insights, but products of labor, class, and economic struggle. What counts as truth in a society functions as ideology, stabilizing existing power relations until material conflict forces change. Like Hegel, Marx believed in an ultimate resolution of contradiction. But for Marx, this resolution would not occur in thought, but in a transformed society where class conflict had been abolished. Only then, he believed, could truth cease to be distorted by material interest.\nRecap: The Fall Of Necessity\nIntuitive certainty as a rational foundation for truth had collapsed.\nDemonstrative reasoning took its place as the last remaining candidate. Necessity replaced certainty, a shift visible even in language. Where certain and its variations dominate the vocabulary of Locke and Hume, not(h)wendig and its derivations come to the fore in Kant, Hegel, Schopenhauer, and Marx.\nEach, in his own way, searched for what must be the case.\nKant and Schopenhauer sought the necessary conditions of experience, and struggled with what such necessity implies. Hegel proposed a dynamic alternative: to follow the inner necessity of the object as it unfolds through contradiction. Marx took over this dialectical structure and grounded it not in thought, but in material history.\nStrikingly, this philosophical turn toward necessity coincides with the rise of Newtonian physics, an era in which laws came to appear not merely descriptive, but binding. Whether this parallel reflects influence or coincidence remains unclear. But the timing is difficult to dismiss.\nStill, something is wrong.\nEach of these thinkers claims necessity. Yet each arrives at a different account of what is necessary.\nIf necessity can justify anything, it justifies nothing.\nAnd so necessity, too, collapses. The attempt to ground truth in what must be the case proves no more stable than grounding it in what cannot be doubted. What once looked like a solid foundation fractures into incompatible systems: different necessities, different structures, different truths.\nFrom the perspective of naive truth theory, this is a breaking point. If multiple, incompatible descriptions each claim correspondence with reality, the notion of a single truth has been abandoned.\nIf certainty failed because it left too little standing, necessity fails because it leaves too much.\nYet philosophy does not end here.\nIf neither certainty nor necessity can secure truth, something else must be doing the work. We step into a world where the old foundations have crumbled, but nothing has replaced them. A world where truth no longer commands, but competes. A world that has not resolved contradiction, only multiplied it.\nThe age of modernity begins.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-ii/05-tracing-truth-the-rise-of-necessity/","title":"5. Tracing Truth: The Rise Of Necessity"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-ii/06-tracing-truth-beyond-necessity/":{"body":"After The Collapse\nCertainty and necessity collapsed as foundations for naive truth. There is no obvious way to ground truth, understood as correspondence with the world. But the journey was not empty. Something was learned along the way.\nStrikingly, everyday life went on.\nWe continue to resolve disagreements in practice. We make predictions. We convict people of crimes. We design systems that function. We mass-produce technology and rely on it. Much of what we do still works.\nIt is tempting to conclude that nothing really happened.\nBut something did happen.\nTruth no longer stands above us as something guaranteed. It is no longer secured by reason, by God, or by history. What once served as a foundation has dissolved. In its place, truth begins to disperse: into language, into practice, into power, into perspective.\nWhat follows is not silence or chaos, but plurality.\nThe central question shifts. It is no longer simply \"What is true?\"\nIt becomes: \"How do we live with what we take to be true, knowing that others hold incompatible convictions with equal seriousness?\"\nThis is the problem the next thinkers confront.\nKierkegaard: The Value Of Truth\nSøren Kierkegaard was among the first to point out that something else had gone wrong in modern philosophy. Not only had its great systems failed to secure naive truth. They had begun to reshape the person who engaged with them.\nThe problem was not merely epistemic. It was existential.\nGeorg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel's vast intellectual structures, Kierkegaard argued, offered a refuge from the most urgent question of all: what does it mean to exist?\nFor Kierkegaard, truth was not an abstract process unfolding in concepts. It was a lived reality. The individual, standing alone before the world, must decide what to believe, what to commit to, and what to live and die for.\nIt is easy to find shelter in the systems we have encountered. Kant's structures, Schopenhauer's Will, Hegel's dialectic, Marx's material analysis all offer coherence, orientation, even conviction. But Kierkegaard asks a different question.\nEven if a system is correct, what does it do to you?\nWhat kind of life does it call you into? What kind of self does it ask you to become?\nFor Kierkegaard, deep conviction does not arise from logic or historical necessity. It arises from anxiety, doubt, and the confrontation with meaning itself. Modern philosophy, he believed, had lost sight of what it means to live. It had traded existence for abstraction, distancing itself from the unsettling reality of being human.\nHegel's vision of history unfolding toward absolute knowledge exemplified this danger. To Kierkegaard, it mistook intellectual completion for understanding. True commitment does not unfold predictably through dialectical stages. It cannot be derived. It must be leapt into.\nIn Fear and Trembling, he writes:\n\"Even if someone\nwere able to transpose the whole content of faith into conceptual form, it does not follow that he has comprehended\nfaith, comprehended how he entered into it or how it entered\ninto him.\"\n(translation by Howard V. Hong and Edna H. Hong)\nThis captures Kierkegaard's central insight: a truth that does not concern you is worthless.\nA philosophical system may describe the world accurately. But if that truth does not alter how one lives, it remains external. It carries no existential weight.\nUnderstanding, in this sense, is not passive. It demands something of the individual. It involves risk. It leaves one changed.\nKierkegaard therefore distinguishes between two kinds of truth.\nObjective truth concerns what can be verified, demonstrated, or established independently of the individual.\nSubjective truth concerns how one stands in relation to what one takes to be true. It is not about the content of belief, but about commitment. It is truth as lived, not merely known.\nKierkegaard does not deny the importance of facts. He denies that facts alone can sustain a meaningful life.\nA person may assent to beliefs about God, justice, or love. But if these convictions do not shape how they live, they remain hollow.\nEither/Or dramatizes this point. It presents two radically different ways of life: the aesthetic life, oriented toward pleasure and detachment, and the ethical life, oriented toward responsibility and commitment. Kierkegaard does not argue for one by refuting the other. He lets them stand, side by side.\nThe reader must choose.\nTruth is not assigned. It is chosen. And in choosing, one becomes it.\nThere is no external vantage point from which this choice can be made. No system can decide in your place.\nIn this sense, Kierkegaard stands opposed to naive truth theory. That theory assumes truth is simply out there, waiting to be discovered by aligning thought with reality. Kierkegaard argues that some truths exist only when they are lived. They have no meaning apart from commitment.\nTruth in faith, love, or personal meaning is not discovered. It is enacted.\nKierkegaard is not rejecting the philosophical search for truth. He is exposing its cost. The system-builders believed they were reaching higher knowledge. Kierkegaard saw something else: a danger in mistaking comprehension for existence. One may grasp the whole system and yet lose oneself in the process.\nImagine the truth of losing someone you love. How is such an experience to be \"brought under the idea\"? How is it to be resolved within an abstract structure of concepts? Kierkegaard's answer is that it cannot be. It must be lived, suffered, endured.\nAnd if it could be fully absorbed into a system, would that not already show what had been lost?\nHegel might reply that the experience of loss and the truth of loss are different things. Kierkegaard refuses this separation. If truth claims to unite reality, it cannot exclude the way reality is lived. A truth that abstracts from existence is not higher truth. It is thinner truth.\nWe do not decide here who is right. But the problem is now unmistakable.\nWhen truth becomes system alone, it consumes the individual instead of orienting them.\nKierkegaard does not deny that naive truth exists. He denies that most of it matters. The truths that shape a life do not come from deduction or demonstration. They arise from conviction and meta-conviction: from what one believes life is for, what one is willing to suffer for, and who one is becoming.\nThese truths are not found. They are lived into.\nThis makes Kierkegaard one of the founders of existentialism. He shifted the question of truth away from foundations and toward responsibility. Truth becomes a demand placed on the individual, not a property of propositions.\nConviction Shift: Kierkegaard\nKierkegaard rejected the idea that truth can be secured by abstract systems alone. For him, the truths that matter most, that is faith, love, meaning, must be lived, not deduced. A truth that does not shape one's existence is no truth at all. Conviction arises not from certainty or necessity, but from commitment. Logic may map the world, but only lived engagement gives truth weight.\nKierkegaard does not deny naive truth. He reorders its importance.\nNietzsche: Truth As A Weapon\nFriedrich Nietzsche took Schopenhauer's diagnosis and reversed its direction.\nWhere Schopenhauer saw tragedy, Nietzsche saw potential.\nWhere Schopenhauer turned away, Nietzsche turned toward.\nNietzsche asked a dangerous question:\nWhat if the Will should not be denied, but affirmed?\nWhat if life, in all its chaos, pain, and contradiction, were not something to escape, but something to embrace?\nFor Nietzsche, truth was never innocent. He believed that the Western tradition—Plato, Christianity, Kant, Hegel—had slowly taught human beings to distrust life itself. Strength was replaced with submission. Vitality with guilt. Instinct with moralized restraint. What passed for \"truth\" was not a neutral discovery, but a cultural achievement shaped to tame, discipline, and domesticate.\nTruth, in this sense, became a weapon. A way of stabilizing values, fixing hierarchies, and discouraging challenge.\nWhenever someone declares something to be true, Nietzsche hears a deeper question beneath it: who benefits from calling this ‘truth'?\nEvery claim to knowledge, he suggests, is embedded in a struggle over meaning. What may present itself as objective necessity often functions as moral judgment, disguised as inevitability. Values are universalized, not because they are eternal, but because they serve particular forms of life.\nYet Nietzsche was not a nihilist. He did not believe that human beings could live without conviction or value.\nWhat he rejected was inherited conviction.\nInstead of clinging to truths handed down by tradition, Nietzsche demanded that individuals take responsibility for their values and create them.\nIn Thus Spoke Zarathustra, his prophetic figure declares:\n\"Man is something that shall be overcome.\"\n[\"Der Mensch ist etwas, das überwunden werden soll.\"]\nWith this, Nietzsche introduces the figure of the Übermensch: not a tyrant, not a brute, but someone who refuses to measure life by borrowed standards. Someone strong enough to will values into existence rather than inherit them unexamined.\nThis is not relativism, and not a free-for-all. Nietzsche does not say that anything goes. He demands something far harder: self-overcoming, creative responsibility, and the courage to live without metaphysical guarantees.\nMorality, Nietzsche argues, often works in the opposite direction. Instead of fostering strength, it offers refuge from it. The language of selflessness, humility, and neighborly love can become a way of avoiding the more difficult task of confronting oneself.\nZarathustra provokes:\n\"You press in close around your neighbor and have fine words for it. But I say to you: your love of neighbor is your poor love of yourselves. You flee to your neighbor to escape yourselves and want to turn this into a virtue; but I see through your ‘selflessness'. [...] Do I advise you to love your neighbor? Rather I advise you to flee from the neighbor and to love the farthest.\"\n[\"Ihr drängt euch um den Nächsten und habt schöne Worte dafür. Aber ich sage euch: eure Nächstenliebe ist eure schlechte Liebe zu euch selber.\nIhr flüchtet zum Nächsten vor euch selber und möchtet euch daraus eine Tugend machen: aber ich durchschaue euer \"Selbstloses\".\n[...]\nRathe ich euch zur Nächstenliebe? Lieber noch rathe ich euch zur Nächsten-Flucht und zur Fernsten-Liebe!\"]\nNietzsche's accusation is sharp: morality can become a technique for turning weakness into virtue, for transforming obedience into righteousness. In contrast, the creator of values does not seek to obey. He seeks to shape.\nThis vision is both liberating and dangerous. If there is no given truth, then who decides what is meaningful? What prevents the collapse into nihilism, cruelty, or domination?\nNietzsche was acutely aware of this risk.\nHis figure of the \"last man\" is not a celebration, but a warning. A world without inherited truths can lead either to self-overcoming or to exhaustion. Faced with uncertainty, people may retreat into comfort, conformity, and distraction. They may choose safety over creation.\nNietzsche thus shattered the idea that truth is neutral. He replaced it with perspectivism: the view that every claim to truth arises from a standpoint, shaped by history, language, physiology, and valuation. There is no view from nowhere.\nThis strikes at the core of naive truth theory. If all knowing is perspectival, then truth cannot be a simple correspondence between thought and reality. What we call truth is always filtered and formed. It is inherited, imposed, or created.\nNietzsche did not merely question truth. He questioned our need for an ultimate truth at all.\nThis made him one of the most disruptive figures in philosophy. His influence reaches into existentialism, where meaning must be created rather than found; into later critiques of ideology and power; and into any view that treats knowledge as inseparable from life.\nBut Nietzsche was not only dismantling. He was offering a form of therapy.\nPhilosophy, for him, was not a doctrine to believe, but an activity that strips away comforting illusions. It should not reassure. It should awaken.\nLike Ludwig Wittgenstein after him, Nietzsche treated philosophy as a tool rather than a system: a way of freeing oneself from traps laid by language, habit, and fear.\nIn a world where truth has lost its guarantees, Nietzsche does not leave us with despair. He leaves us with something more demanding.\nFreedom.\nConviction Shift: Nietzsche\nNietzsche rejected the idea that truth is neutral or eternal. He exposed truth as bound up with valuation, power, and perspective. Convictions are not born from clarity alone, but from will and need. The task is not to inherit meaning, but to take responsibility for creating it. Nietzsche did not offer a new theory of truth. He issued a challenge: dismantle what weakens you, and forge values strong enough to sustain life without illusions. Philosophy, for him, is not about being right. It is about becoming capable.\nJames: Truth In Action\nWilliam James and Nietzsche responded to the same crisis: the collapse of necessity. But they moved in opposite directions. Nietzsche turned inward and asked what truth conceals. James turned outward and asked what truth does.\nJames had little interest in truth as an abstract ideal. He was impatient with metaphysical debates about ultimate reality. What mattered to him was what our beliefs actually accomplish in lived experience.\nDo they help us orient ourselves?\nDo they survive contact with the world?\nDo they work?\nBut if truth is not fixed or absolute, what distinguishes it from mere opinion?\nJames' answer was pragmatic but not permissive: truth must prove itself. A belief may feel useful in the moment and still fail under pressure. A true belief is one that holds up over time, across experience, and under continued scrutiny.\nTruth is not something waiting to be uncovered. It is something that emerges through action. Our convictions are not static mirrors of reality. They are instruments. Where rationalists sought certainty and idealists sought necessity, James proposed something humbler and more resilient: truth is what continues to work, \"in the long run and on the whole\". Until it doesn't. And when it no longer does, it ceases to be true.\nTruth operates within a network of beliefs. We do not verify everything ourselves. Much of what we count as true is inherited on trust. Verification often happens indirectly, deferred in time, or carried by others. A belief does not need to be immediately verified to be true. It needs to be verifiable in principle.\nJames formulates this instrumental view of truth in Pragmatism:\n\"Any idea upon which we can ride, so to speak; any idea that will carry us prosperously from any one part of our experience to any other part, linking things satisfactorily, working securely, simplifying, saving labor; is true for just so much, true in so far forth, true instrumentally. This is the ‘instrumental' view of truth.\"\nAnd he sharpens the point in The Meaning of Truth:\n\"Grant an idea or belief to be true, what concrete difference will its being true make in any one's actual life? What experiences [may] be different from those which would obtain if the belief were false? How will the truth be realized? What, in short, is the truth's cash-value in experiential terms?\nTrue ideas are those that we can assimilate, validate, corroborate, and verify. False ideas are those we cannot. That is the practical difference it makes to us to have true ideas; that therefore is the meaning of truth, for it is all that truth is known as.\"\nDoes this mean we must constantly test every belief we hold?\nNo. James explicitly rejects that picture. Truth, he says, lives largely on credit:\n\"Truth lives, in fact, for the most part on a credit system. Our thoughts and beliefs ‘pass,' so long as nothing challenges them, just as bank-notes pass so long as nobody refuses them.\nBut this all points to direct face-to-face verifications somewhere, without which the fabric of truth collapses like a financial system with no cash-basis whatever. You accept my verification of one thing, I yours of another. We trade on each other's truth. But beliefs verified concretely by somebody are the posts of the whole superstructure.\"\nVerification, then, is not an abstract criterion. It is a practice.\nWe verify the ground by walking on it.\nWe verify that there is a tree by seeing it, circling it, touching it, returning later, asking others, perhaps even climbing it.\nThis, James argues, is the real content of correspondence. Correspondence is not a metaphysical relation between propositions and an inaccessible reality. It is grounded in what we do and what holds up when we do it.\nVerification is not something to be pursued compulsively. Absolute certainty is often unavailable, and waiting for it would paralyze action. In many situations, we must commit before proof is possible. That is not a defect. It is a feature of human life.\nThis is especially clear in domains such as morality, religion, and personal identity, where action is unavoidable and final proof is out of reach. Here, belief precedes verification, not because we are careless, but because life demands it.\nJames shares something with Kierkegaard at this point. But where Kierkegaard emphasizes inward commitment, James emphasizes outward testing. Truth is not sealed by a leap. It is earned, provisionally, through continued engagement with experience.\nTruth, for James, is not a static property that ideas either possess or lack. It is a function of ideas over time. Like health, it is not a single event but an ongoing condition. A true idea need not always be under inspection, just as a healthy body need not always be tested. It is enough that it would withstand scrutiny when challenged.\nTruth, then, is not a monument. It is a map. Not something discovered once and for all, but something continually revised as we move.\nIn this sense, truth is simply the long, patient work of verification. No metaphysical essence, no hidden depth. Just what continues to hold up, for the lives we actually live.\nJames' approach is notably frugal. He builds no grand system. He claims only what is needed to move forward. In that restraint, pragmatism shows a natural kinship with Conviction Formation Theory.\nConviction Shift: James\nJames reframed truth as a process rather than a possession. Truth is not what mirrors an absolute reality, but what proves itself through experience and action. Beliefs become true by being tested, verified, and sustained over time. Much of what we take to be true rests on shared trust and deferred verification. But real truth remains anchored in lived practice. Truth is not something we finally arrive at. It is something we maintain, revise, and sometimes abandon.\nJames leaves naive truth theory largely intact, but strips it of metaphysical ambition. Correspondence remains, but it is grounded in human practices rather than eternal structures. Truth becomes a habit of successful engagement with the world: provisional, social, and always open to correction.\nWittgenstein: Truth Has Many Functions\nFew philosophers reshaped philosophy twice. Ludwig Wittgenstein did. His early work helped define analytic philosophy. His later work quietly dismantled its ambitions. Taken together, they mark one of the most instructive failures of foundational truth-seeking.\nWittgenstein began by trying to finish philosophy. He ended by showing why it cannot be finished.\nEarly Wittgenstein: Truth As Logical Representation\nWittgenstein entered philosophy through logic. Bertrand Russell recognized his talent immediately and hoped Wittgenstein would help complete the analytic project: grounding truth in logical form.\nThat ambition culminated in the Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, a strange and austere book. It consists of seven numbered propositions and their sub-propositions. There are no arguments. The structure itself is meant to show what can be said.\nThe core idea is the picture theory of language. The world consists of facts. Propositions are logical pictures of those facts. A proposition is true if the structure of the picture matches the structure of reality.\nComplex propositions decompose into atomic propositions, each corresponding to a simple fact that either holds or does not hold. To check truth is to check these facts.\nFalse propositions still have meaning. They are pictures that fail to match the world. What lacks meaning altogether are sentences that do not picture any possible state of affairs.\nThis is a fully articulated version of naive truth theory. Thought corresponds to reality through shared logical form. Philosophy, on this view, has no task beyond clarifying this structure. Once the logic is laid bare, philosophical problems dissolve.\nWhat the Tractatus never questions is its central assumption: that formal logic is the right lens for understanding all meaningful language. That assumption is treated as self-evident.\nWittgenstein regarded the Tractatus as the correct philosophy. He believed it had resolved all the problems that were known to exist for this kind of logical theory of language. From this, he drew a far-reaching conclusion: that with the Tractatus, the problems of philosophy itself had been solved. Having said everything that could be said with sense, he concluded that what remained must be passed over in silence.\nHe left academia, gave away his fortune, trained as a schoolteacher, and lived in rural Austria. Philosophy, he thought, was over.\nIt wasn't.\nLater Wittgenstein: Truth As Language In Use\nYears later, Wittgenstein returned with a radically different view. The mistake, he now believed, was not a technical error in logic. It was the idea that language has a single underlying structure at all.\nLanguage is not a mirror of reality. It is a human activity.\nMeaning does not come from logical form. It comes from use, from rule-governed practices embedded in what he called forms of life. Words mean what they do because of how they are taught, learned, and employed in shared activities.\nWittgenstein illustrates this shift in Philosophical Investigations:\n\"The word 'language-game' is meant to emphasize here, that speaking a language is part of an activity, or of a form of life.\"\n[\"Das Wort 'Sprachspiel' soll hier hervorheben, dass das Sprechen einer Sprache ein Teil einer Tätigkeit ist, oder einer Lebensform.\" (PU 27)]\nHe lists an open-ended variety of language-games: describing, commanding, measuring, calculating, joking, praying, thanking, cursing, storytelling, reporting, hypothesizing. There is no essence common to all of them.\nMeaning arises inside these games. Outside them, words are inert.\nTruth changes its role accordingly. Some language-games use truth and falsity as central concepts. Others do not. A promise is not true or false in the same way a report is. A prayer is not verified the way a measurement is.\nThere is no single criterion of truth that applies everywhere.\nWittgenstein drives this home with a simple example: a builder and an assistant. The builder calls \"block\" or \"beam\". The assistant fetches the material. That is the whole language. The words mean what they do because of training and practice. Nothing more is required.\nAnd justification ends somewhere:\n\"If I have exhausted the justifications, I have reached bedrock and my spade is turned. Then I am inclined to say: This is simply what I do.\"\n[\"Habe ich die Begründungen erschöpft, so bin ich nun auf dem harten Felsen angelangt, und mein Spaten biegt sich zurück\" (PU 217)]\nThis is not relativism, but anti-foundationalism. There is no deeper explanation hiding behind practice. There is no metaphysical guarantee waiting to be uncovered. There is only what we do, together, competently, over time.\nNaive truth still has a role, especially in descriptive language-games. \"There is a tree\" works across many practices. What changes is not its usefulness, but its status. It is no longer grounded in correspondence as a metaphysical relation. It is grounded in how it functions across our activities.\nTruth, then, has many functions. Sometimes it maps the world. Sometimes it guides action. Sometimes it preserves inference. No single account captures them all.\nSeen this way, Wittgenstein goes further than James. James ties truth to verification over time. Wittgenstein shows that even verification presupposes a form of life in which certain moves count as checking, doubting, confirming.\nTruth does not rest on certainty. It does not rest on necessity. It rests on participation.\nWhat remains is not a theory of truth, but a way of living with conviction without final foundations.\nConviction Shift: Wittgenstein\nWittgenstein abandoned the search for a single foundation of truth. In his later work, he showed that meaning arises from use within shared human practices. Truth takes different forms in different language-games, and justification always comes to an end in action. There is no final argument beneath our convictions. Only the ways of acting, speaking, and responding that make them intelligible. Convictions, like language itself, live in forms of life. They do not rest on certainty or necessity. They rest on what we do.\nRecap: Beyond Necessity\nSomething unexpected happened. Truth has proven as elusive as the Fountain of Youth. Perhaps just as mythical. Nobody knows what it is, or how it works, in the strong sense philosophy once demanded.\nAnd yet, we do know how to go on.\nWe know how to describe the world in practice. We know how to distinguish claims that hold up from those that fail. We know how to build systems that work, to correct errors, to coordinate action, to hold one another accountable.\nSo does it really matter that we cannot define truth?\nWe have also learned something else along the way. Convictions are not neutral. They can reflect power structures. They can shape identities. They can clash, entangle, and tear people apart. Integrating strong convictions is often difficult, sometimes transformative, sometimes painful.\nWhat about undeniability, certainty, necessity? Do they still matter?\nIn many domains of life, they do. But as foundations for philosophy, they appear to have reached their limit.\nPerhaps it is time to let go.\nNot of care, not of rigor, not of seriousness. But of the demand that philosophy must rest on something absolute. Perhaps the word \"truth\" belongs primarily to foundational inquiry, while our real need lies elsewhere: in the formation, shaping, and careful cultivation of convictions. Not to serve an ideal above us, but to live better lives. To become coherent, responsible, inhabitable selves. By criteria we can actually stand behind.\nConvictions are real. They shape how we live, how we act, how we understand one another.\nShifting the focus from truth to conviction does not impoverish philosophy. It frees it from an impossible task. It gives us permission to make meaning without pretending to possess final foundations. It restores our right to be individuals.\nThis shift is not merely thematic. It reaches into the very form philosophy takes.\nTime and again, systematic philosophical programs have promised completeness and failed. And we now understand why. Gödel showed that no sufficiently expressive formal system can prove its own consistency. Computer science shows us that reasoning costs time, that some problems are permanently out of reach, and that complexity overwhelms even clean formal languages. Software engineering shows us, daily, that human beings make mistakes even in tightly constrained systems, and that large systems behave in ways no single person can fully grasp.\nThese lessons reflect back on philosophy itself.\nIt seems more honest to assume that philosophy must work in small, modular pieces. Carved out of the whole. Limited in scope. Explicit in commitment.\nIt also resolves a second problem we encountered. Science has experiments that provide feedback about the quality of a theory. Philosophy does not. It moves among possibilities. And when multiple internally coherent views are available, the question is no longer which one is \"true,\" but which one is more habitable.\nWhat problems of living does this view actually address?\nWhat does it make intelligible, and what does it render marginal or unspeakable?\nAnd what ways of acting, valuing, or relating does it quietly commit us to?\nOnce philosophy is approached in this way, restraint becomes unavoidable. Any view that claims to answer too much risks distorting what it cannot contain. Reality exceeds system. Human life exceeds logic. And belief exceeds proof.\nThere is another danger we have seen as well. Grand systems tend to freeze the present. They promote what happens to be dominant as what must be the case. Necessity becomes ideology.\nFocusing on convictions instead keeps this danger in view. Convictions can be examined, compared, revised, and sometimes abandoned. They can be held strongly without pretending to be inevitable.\nWhat remains, then, is not a final foundation, but a practice: the ongoing work of forming, testing, and carrying convictions in a world that resists closure.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-ii/06-tracing-truth-beyond-necessity/","title":"6. Tracing Truth: Beyond Necessity"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-iii/":{"body":"","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-iii/","title":"On Conviction Formation III - Practice And Orientation"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-iii/07-how-to-make-use-of-conviction-formation-theory/":{"body":"Letting Go of Truth\nThe word truth carries a long history. It comes with expectations of certainty, final standards, and external validation. In practice, these expectations are rarely met.\nFor most decisions we actually face, truth does not function as a usable guide. It offers no clear procedure, no shared test, and no reliable stopping point. Instead, it often introduces hesitation where action is required, and doubt where orientation would suffice.\nConviction Formation Theory proposes a different starting point.\nRather than asking whether a belief is true, it asks what convinces us, why it does so, and how that conviction holds up in practice. This shift does not deny reality, nor does it abandon care or rigor. It changes the unit of analysis from abstract correspondence to lived orientation.\nConvictions carry less philosophical weight than truth, but more practical clarity. They describe what we actually rely on when we act, decide, judge, and commit. They can be examined, compared, strengthened, revised, or replaced without appealing to an unreachable standard.\nLetting go of truth, in this sense, is not a loss. It is a release from a frame that promises more than it can deliver, and often obscures what is already doing the real work.\nThis does not mean that anything goes. It means that responsibility shifts inward: from defending beliefs as true to understanding and tending the convictions we live by.\nThere are still traps to avoid.\nAnd there are better and worse ways to work with convictions.\nThat is where practice begins.\nCounterbalancing Old Modes Of Thought\nTo make use of Conviction Formation Theory, it helps to actively counterbalance inherited habits of thought around truth.\nThese habits had centuries to shape our language, our education, and our assumptions. They do not disappear on their own. But with a few simple shifts, they can be loosened.\nWhen you hear \"is true,” think:\n\"This is the best conviction we have so far.”\nIf someone says, \"It's true, he's a talented musician,” you might reframe it as:\n\"My best conviction is that he's a talented musician.”\nEven when \"true” is only implied, \"He is a talented musician,” you can still hear:\n\"That's what I'm currently convinced of.”\nThis reframing makes disagreement less threatening. Instead of arguing over truth, one can simply say:\n\"I see that you're convinced. I'm not convinced yet.”\nWhen you hear \"a true X,” think:\n\"I'm convinced this is an exemplary X.”\nInstead of, \"That was a true act of courage,” try:\n\"I'm convinced this act was exemplary of courage.”\nThe emphasis shifts from definition to judgment.\nWhen you hear \"Is X true?” think:\n\"How did this conviction form, and what sustains it?”\nIf someone asks, \"Has justice been truly served here?” you might hear:\n\"Do I find this a convincing act of justice? Which aspects persuade me, and which do not?”\nIf you ask yourself, \"Is this relationship really over?” you might now hear:\n\"What convinces me that it is over? What doubts remain? What would need to change?”\nOr when asking, \"Do I find this idea meaningful?”:\n\"What makes something feel meaningful to me, and under what conditions might that change?”\nThese shifts do not eliminate disagreement or uncertainty. They make them workable.\nHow This Helps In Practice\nWhen justifying yourself, you do not need to appeal to absolute truth. You can say:\n\"These are my values. These are my convictions. I've reflected on them and tried to refine them. Like everyone else, I act on what genuinely convinces me.”\nIf someone asks why you do or don't do something, for example, \"Why don't you eat meat?”, you don't need to universalize your answer:\n\"These are my values and convictions. I understand that this may not matter as much to you. That's okay. I experience it differently.”\nIf you are trying to find a compromise with someone whose convictions differ from yours:\n\"You hold these convictions, I hold others. There's no need to convert one another. But perhaps we can find an arrangement that respects both.”\nIf you are trying to motivate yourself:\n\"These are the convictions I live by. Acting against them would leave me misaligned with myself.”\nThis kind of clarity requires knowing what your convictions actually are.\nWhat do you care about?\nWhich lines do you not want to cross, not because you were told not to, but because crossing them would leave you with regret or shame?\nIf you are trying to motivate a group or community:\n\"We share these convictions. They have guided us so far. Let's act in a way that remains consistent with them.”\nShared convictions often form the bedrock of social groups, whether explicitly stated or implicitly assumed. Political movements, cultural traditions, professional codes, and civic ideals all rely on this structure.\nThe deeper reason for translating truth talk into conviction talk is not rhetorical. It is practical.\nConviction language keeps attention on why something convinces us, rather than on whether it satisfies an abstract and unreachable standard. That shift redirects energy away from stalemate and toward reflection, dialogue, and action.\nAnalysis Paralysis And Decision-Making\nMany decisions stall not because they are complex, but because they are measured against an imagined external standard. Is this the right choice? Am I missing something decisive?\nCarefulness matters. Reflection matters.\nWhat becomes unproductive is the demand for certainty where none is available.\nFor most decisions that actually matter, there is no external standard comparable to arithmetic. No final test that settles the matter once and for all. Waiting for that level of security leads to paralysis, not better judgment.\nDecisions still need to be made. With reasonable confidence.\nIn practice, this means trusting your current best conviction after serious reflection, while remaining open to revision. There is nothing more available to a finite thinker.\nWhen you are stuck, it can help to ask:\nWhat do I already believe is the best course of action?\nWhat doubts or counterarguments remain?\nWhat, if anything, could realistically change my conviction?\nIf no new considerations emerge, act on your current conviction and move forward.\nWe act based on what convinces us now. If better convictions emerge later, we adjust. No one ever did more than that.\nOne deeply ingrained habit deserves explicit attention here.\nIn a truth-centered frame, being wrong is treated as a failure. Error carries guilt. Revision feels like defeat. This makes hesitation understandable: if the cost of acting is being wrong, and being wrong is shameful, then not acting feels safer.\nThis view operates under a different norm. Being wrong is not a moral failure. It is information. What matters is not avoiding error, but remaining capable of revision.\nA system that cannot tolerate error cannot learn. A person who cannot revise convictions cannot grow.\nLowering the demand for certainty does not eliminate responsibility. It redraws its boundary.\nA finite thinker cannot be held responsible for every conclusion derivable from an idealized body of information. Responsibility attaches to what can reasonably be expected given one's situation: available evidence, time, cognitive capacity, and the practical costs of further inquiry.\nThis does not excuse negligence. It distinguishes it from limitation. You are responsible for reflecting seriously, noticing salient counterarguments, and not ignoring doubts already visible to you. You are not responsible for foreseeing every implication, or for reaching conclusions that would require resources you do not have.\nSo the aim is not perfect certainty. It is responsible movement under uncertainty.\nBut Don't We Need Truth?\nIf you feel resistance to letting go of truth, you're not alone.\nThe pull of truth is not just intellectual. It is emotional. It is tied to how we justify ourselves, how we defend our actions, and how we hope to stand on something firm when challenged. Truth promises stability. It promises an end to doubt.\nIt is understandable to want that.\nBut it is worth asking what truth has actually delivered.\nFor centuries, from at least the days of the Agora of Athens, some of the most careful and brilliant thinkers tried to explain how truth works. They did not fail for lack of effort or intelligence. They failed because the promise itself was larger than what finite thinkers could fulfill.\nEven mathematics offers a telling example. Mathematical truth was once grounded in intuition: pebbles on the ground, geometric diagrams, constructions drawn with compass and straightedge. Proofs were persuasive and illuminating, not formally exhaustive. Over time, as disputes accumulated and foundations were questioned, mathematics developed formal systems to discipline proof more rigorously.\nThat shift took centuries. It solved some problems and introduced others. It stabilized conviction under very specific conditions. It did not reveal a timeless realm of certainty accessible to human minds.\nAnd even that solution cannot simply be exported to ethics, politics, meaning, or life decisions.\nWhat we actually want are convictions we do not doubt.\nDoubt can come from many sources. From conflicting evidence. From incoherence. From experience. But it need not come from the inability to prove that a conviction is absolutely true.\nTruth, as an idea, adds only one thing to a well-formed conviction: a metaphysical claim that it is timeless, unchangeable, and immune to revision.\nThose qualities are not available to us. And no reliable proxies for them have ever been found.\nWhat we do have are the tools we already use to form and refine conviction: reflection, evidence, coherence, practical consequences, and dialogue. Conviction Formation Theory does not take anything essential away. It simply refuses to promise what cannot be delivered.\nDon't We Still Need Truth to Live Together?\nIt's a reasonable worry: if there is no absolute truth, doesn't everyone just live by their own standards?\nBut if we look honestly, that is already the case.\nWe live by what convinces us. We appeal to evidence, experience, rules, procedures, traditions, and tools we trust. When we say we decided \"on the balance of all evidence,” what we really mean is that, at a certain point, one direction felt more convincing than the alternatives. Sometimes that balancing is informal and intuitive. Sometimes it is mediated by methods we have learned to rely on. But in all cases, it rests on prior convictions about what counts and what matters.\nThis does not lead to chaos.\nMost disagreements fall into one of two patterns.\nOften, people disagree about a conclusion but share enough background convictions to argue meaningfully. They recognize what would count as a relevant consideration, even if they weigh it differently. In such cases, disagreement is not a breakdown. It is a sign that conviction formation is still in progress.\nMore deeply, people sometimes disagree about what counts as a good argument or a successful outcome in the first place. Even here, communication does not collapse. We can understand how a conclusion follows from another person's standards, even if it does not follow from our own. That understanding is often enough to coordinate, negotiate, or peacefully diverge.\nThe fear of a total breakdown assumes something more extreme: that people could have completely incompatible standards across perception, reasoning, action, and meaning. But such a scenario is hard to make sense of. Human life is constrained by shared vulnerabilities, bodies, needs, and practices. We speak, hesitate, cooperate, grieve, and care in broadly recognizable ways. This shared background is not guaranteed by truth. It is sustained by life itself.\nIn practice, our common ground is vast. We agree provisionally on what we can see and do, on tools and routines, on how to coordinate action, and on how to disagree without everything falling apart.\nWe do not live in a Tower of Babel.\nAbandoning truth as a metaphysical guarantee does not remove the possibility of shared life. It clarifies what already makes it possible: conviction, dialogue, and the ongoing effort to understand and adjust to one another.\nIs Conviction Formation Theory an Excuse to Avoid Engagement?\nIt might sound tempting to say: \"That's my conviction,” and end the discussion.\nBut that only works if convictions were something you could choose at will.\nThey aren't.\nSomething convinces you, or it doesn't. Conviction formation is not about picking a position and defending it out of pride or convenience. It is about noticing what actually moves you, and staying open to what might move you further.\nIf someone answered every challenge with \"That's just my conviction,” not as a description but as a shield, this would not signal strength or depth. It would signal disengagement. People would stop taking the conversation seriously, and move on.\nThat is not conviction formation. That is avoiding it.\nConvictions do not stand alone. Each one gains its meaning and force from its relation to others. When one shifts, others tend to shift with it. You cannot isolate a single conviction from the rest of your outlook and treat it as untouchable without distorting it.\nFor this reason, conviction formation assumes revisability. Not because convictions are weak, but because they are alive. Treating them as finished objects misunderstands what they are.\nSeen this way, genuine engagement is not a threat to conviction. It is one of the conditions under which convictions can remain coherent and responsive to reality.\nDialogue is not a game to be won. It is a situation in which convictions meet other convictions, and either hold, adjust, or give way.\nConviction Formation Theory does not license disengagement. It makes disengagement visible for what it is.\nDo We Still Need Truth for Ethics and a Good Life?\nEthics is often presented as a system of universal rules. Principles that apply to everyone, everywhere, regardless of circumstance. Many people assume that without such rules, there can be no serious moral orientation.\nBut in practice, most ethical life does not work this way.\nPeople do not live by abstract moral systems. They live by convictions about who they are, what they care about, what they regret, and what they want to stand for when things become difficult. These convictions are shaped by experience, reflection, failure, and learning. Not by access to timeless moral truth.\nSeen through this lens, ethics is not a set of eternal laws. It is a set of supports. Reminders and constraints that help us act in line with what we are genuinely convinced matters, especially when habit, fear, or convenience pull us elsewhere.\nEthical rules function like tools. They are situation-bound, revisable, and limited in number. A rule that cannot be carried with ease stops helping. A rule that produces constant guilt or paralysis undermines its own purpose.\nThis applies both to individuals and to groups. Shared ethical rules help coordinate behavior and stabilize trust. They can be internalized, adapted, or discarded as circumstances change. Their value lies in what they enable, not in their claim to universality.\nIn practice, ethical guidance often takes a simple form:\n\"If you encounter X, do Y.”\nFor someone who feels disconnected, ineffective, or misaligned, a rule like \"Leave people and places a little better than you found them” may sound trivial. But it can function as a temporary orientation. A way to bridge the gap between current habits and a better-aligned way of living, until that orientation becomes second nature or needs revision.\nThese are not claims to moral truth. They are working convictions. Tools shaped by reflection and need, meant to support movement toward a life that feels coherent and worth living.\nEthics, understood this way, does not collapse without truth. It becomes practical, personal, and responsive. Exactly as lived ethics already is.\nWhy Are Convictions Worth Cultivating?\nIf Conviction Formation Theory removes the idea of external validation through absolute truth, then why care about refining your convictions at all?\nIt's a fair question. And the answer begins here:\nConviction Formation Theory does not eliminate external validation. It understands it differently.\nYou do not choose your convictions. You do not choose your meta-convictions either. They are already there, shaping how you see, judge, and act. Ignoring them is not neutrality. It is a minimal form of care, much like neglecting the needs of your body.\nConviction Formation Theory offers a mirror. It helps you see where you already stand, and how you might grow from there, according to the values you already carry.\nWe can see what happens when convictions are not cultivated.\nLives drift. Efforts lose coherence. Meaning thins out. Not because of a lack of intelligence, but because of a lack of inner structure. Without care, convictions still grow. But like a garden left unattended, what grows may not nourish you.\nYou are already becoming some version of yourself, whether you reflect on it or not. Conviction Formation Theory does not impose an ideal from the outside. It helps you understand which version of yourself you are actually becoming, and whether that feels like a place you can live in.\nExternal validation has always been part of human life. We test ourselves against the world, against others, against consequences. What Conviction Formation Theory rejects is not validation, but the idea that it must take the form of comparing sentences to an abstract, unreachable reality.\nCultivating convictions appears to be a necessary condition for plans and projects to succeed at all. When convictions are misaligned with the social and natural world they operate in, action falters. When they are refined, action gains direction.\nAnd cultivation unlocks something quieter, but no less important:\nA sense of orientation.\nA feeling of alignment with oneself.\nA resilience that does not collapse under pressure.\nA steadiness that remains even when circumstances shift.\nHuman beings seem to be born with an urge to explore. Children play to discover, not to justify. They ask questions to connect, not to win. They take things apart to understand how they work.\nBehind this lies something older than philosophy: a drive to make sense of the world, and of oneself. Curiosity is not a luxury. It is a condition of life. In humans, it becomes reflection. And reflection, over time, becomes the cultivation of conviction.\nSeen this way, caring for your convictions is not a burden imposed by theory or morality. It is a continuation of a process already underway.\nA well-cultivated conviction set is a place you can live in.\nConvictions As Emotional Anchors\nConvictions also play a quiet emotional role. They stabilize us. They give us something to stand on when the world around us shifts.\nThis is why losing a conviction can feel not just confusing, but devastating. It can feel like losing a part of oneself. Even when a conviction no longer works, we may cling to it, because the alternative feels like emotional free fall.\nEmotion and conviction reinforce each other. Strong emotions can solidify convictions, and enduring convictions can shape the emotional tone of an entire life. This interplay is deep and complex, and we can only gesture at it here. It deserves its own careful treatment.\nFor now, it is enough to recognize this:\nConviction is not only about what we believe. It is also about what keeps us upright.\nHow To Best Cultivate Convictions\nWe are back in the garden now. Our garden.\nCultivating convictions starts with attention. Not abstract attention, but lived attention: to how you choose, act, hesitate, and commit.\nListen. Be curious. Weigh and balance. Notice connections.\nConvictions already form a connected landscape. They support each other, constrain each other, and sometimes pull in different directions. What appears as conflict at one level may belong together at another. What matters is not purity, but coherence.\nSo engage them. Reflect on them. Let them speak.\nFinding out who you are, and who you want to become, is not a matter of introspection alone. Values and goals often reveal themselves through action, through tension, through regret and satisfaction. You learn what matters by seeing what moves you, and what leaves you uneasy.\nSimple practices help:\n\n\nthink deliberately\n\n\nread slowly\n\n\nwrite things down\n\n\nkeep notes or a diary\n\n\nreturn to questions over time\n\n\nTreat yourself as someone worth taking seriously.\nAnd talk to people who genuinely convince you. Not to win arguments, but to compare gardens. To see what grows well elsewhere, and what doesn't. Convictions refine themselves through exposure, not isolation.\nConviction Formation Theory does not tell you what to think. It offers no finished system to inhabit. It is deliberately small, open, and incomplete. Its purpose is not to replace your convictions, but to help you work with the ones you already have.\nIf you are inclined toward structured tools, some can support this work.\nUnderstanding how logic works, and where it stops working, sharpens judgment. Probability theory helps when certainty is unavailable but decisions must still be made. Treating beliefs as revisable rather than fixed can make thinking more responsive and less brittle.\nSome people explore this through formal methods, others through careful reflection. Both approaches cultivate the same capacity: responsiveness to what holds up over time.\nYou don't need mathematics, statistics, or formal models to cultivate convictions. But if they draw you, they offer additional ways to test coherence, explore uncertainty, and notice when something only feels convincing because it hasn't been challenged yet.\nHowever you tend your garden, cultivation begins the same way: with attention.\nConviction is what pattern recognition feels like from the inside. When something fits, it clicks. This isn't irrational. It's how experience integrates itself. Sometimes wisely, sometimes too quickly. Cultivation means learning when to trust that click, and when to slow it down.\nSo What Does It Mean To Live By Conviction Rather Than By Truth?\nIt means no longer searching for a foundation that isn't there.\nIt means standing in what genuinely convinces you, while knowing that tomorrow you may hold better convictions than the ones you hold today.\nIt means stepping out of the exhausting cycle of proving something \"true” and instead engaging with what actually holds: what persuades, resists doubt, and guides action.\nConviction formation is not a destination. It is a path. Open, revisable, and forward-moving.\nThe difference from the old truth mindset is not merely theoretical. It is lived.\nEveryone begins with a small, often naive set of convictions. Everyone outgrows some of them. Everyone looks back at something they once believed and thinks: If only I had known then what I know now.\nThat is not failure.\nThat is growth.\nAnd growth is not an exception to conviction formation. It is its core mechanism.\nLiving by conviction also frees us from a common trap: fusing belief with identity.\nWhen a belief becomes sacred, any challenge to it feels like a threat to the self. Defense replaces reflection. Stagnation replaces learning.\nBut if conviction formation is understood as an ongoing process, then letting go is not betrayal.\nIt is renewal.\nYour convictions are there to serve you. Not to own you.\nWhat matters is not having everything settled. It is having enough orientation to act, enough openness to revise, and enough care to refine what you live by.\nWhat matters is tending the garden.\nPaying attention.\nAdjusting.\nAnd cultivating what truly holds in your life.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/on-conviction-formation-iii/07-how-to-make-use-of-conviction-formation-theory/","title":"7. How To Make Use Of Conviction Formation Theory"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/":{"body":"","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/","title":"Opinion And Strategy"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/01-possibilities-and-commitment/":{"body":"(1) There are many ways of defining what an opinion is, each foregrounding or backgrounding different aspects of a familiar phenomenon.\nFor the present purpose, it is helpful to think of opinions in a very ordinary way: as the answers we give when we are asked what we think of something.\n\"What do you think of x?\"\n\"What is your opinion on x?\"\n\"What do I make of x?\"\nIn answering such questions, we usually take into account some possibilities of what we could think about x. An opinion is the one possibility that stands out to us. \"That is what I think about x!\" It feels right, plausible, or fitting. Belief, you could say, has attached to it.\n(2) Opinions are a good tool. Time-tested like not many others. In the world close to us, opinions are not only harmless but necessary. We hold opinions about people we meet every day, about the character of a colleague, the reliability of a neighbor, the way a friend reacts under stress. We form opinions about the places we go, the routines that shape our days, the unwritten rules of our small world, the meaning of actions, and who we are. These opinions help us navigate the familiar. They are a kind of shorthand for lived experience.\nIn this sense, opinions are how we understand our observations and interactions.\nThey reflect how we connect the threads we observe into a provisional whole.\n(3) That may be the prime reason why we shudder at contradictions in our opinions.\nAll of a sudden there is not one whole story anymore, but two that cannot be reconciled.\nWe, as a person, are split in two.\n(4) The more we understand about the world, the more we try, learn, build, and play, the more possibilities emerge.\nExperience, as we learn from it, expands our ability to create possibilities.\n(5) Some of these possibilities are simply taken from lists.\n\"Which candidate do you think is more competent?\"\nOr surveys that ask your opinion on certain topics, giving you sets of possible answers.\n(6) Most of the times however, building and constructing an opinion is more complicated than this.\nIn most situations, possibilities are not given. They have to be assembled from fragments: observations, memories, expectations, and partial information. But also emotions, habits, and circumstances.\nDifferent possibilities can fit the same observations. The same facts can be connected into different stories, depending on what is emphasized, ignored, or taken as background.\nAn opinion settles this openness. It privileges one way of connecting the threads over the others. The situation becomes intelligible again. Action becomes possible.\n(7) Opinions are not formed in isolation.\nThey are ways of making sense of a world we share with others. For them to guide action, coordination, and responsibility, they cannot drift too far apart.\nSome ways of connecting the threads must be abandoned, others stabilized, not because they are comforting, but because life together requires a degree of shared orientation.\nIf our opinions are to be worth anything as instruments for living a good life, it matters how they are formed.\n(8) Opinions are not the only mode of thinking.\nSometimes, most of the belief does not attach to an option right away. Some belief attaches to some options, but only faintly.\nWhere experience is rich, feedback is quick, and correction is possible, we can try and test the different options, as they have different effects. We can exclude all but one if we are lucky.\n(9) But there are situations where these conditions no longer hold. The world becomes larger than our experience, consequences outrun correction, and action cannot wait for shared understanding to stabilize.\nHistorically, within the first settlements and villages, opinions probably played a major role. The focus of life was for most a local community, where you were born, raised, lived and were buried and remembered, and that is still true today. Most of the judgments, friendships, disputes, loyalties, and suspicions played out among people you interacted with day by day.\nTraders and adventurers, bringers of ideas and news and practices around the trade routes that go back before written history, have most likely stronger relied on a thinking mode called strategy, because they could not afford opinions on their travels. Prepared for many things to come, they carried the first faint outlines of a wider humanity.\n(10) A strategy works with the options to which at least some belief attaches.\nInstead of settling on a single one, it keeps all of them in play. The goal is now not to determine which possibility is correct as quickly as possible, but to act in ways that remain acceptable across the different possibilities that received a small amount of credibility.\nThis mode of reasoning does not aim to be right. It aims to avoid being wrong in ways that matter.\n(11) When we reason this way, we choose actions that are acceptable under all of the possibilities we currently consider. As new information arrives, the possibilities can be adjusted, and the actions revised accordingly. Belief is present in small quantities, but it is provisional.\nThis is what adventurers did and what investors do. This is what you do when you pack your suitcase, when you are not sure what the weather will be at the destination.\n(12) Opinion and strategy are not competing virtues. They are two ways of working with possibilities.\nOpinions close them in order to act decisively in familiar contexts or where information is readily available.\nStrategies keep them open in order to act robustly in unfamiliar ones.\nMost real situations lie somewhere between these two poles, and move from one to the other as they unfold.\nIf you have a strong opinion, you do not need a strategy.\nAnd if you have a good strategy, you have no need for a strong opinion.\nAs you move between these poles, different equilibria are possible.\nBut you cannot have all belief on one option, and at the same time only a little bit on many options. That is a contradiction.\n(13) Together, opinions and strategies open a space within which thinking can happen.\nThis space allows us to balance commitment and openness in the face of uncertainty.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/01-possibilities-and-commitment/","title":"1. Possibilities And Commitment"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/02-the-imbalance-of-opinion-and-strategy/":{"body":"(14) News in our times is no longer carried by traders and adventurers. It travels at the speed of light across the globe. We form opinions about people we have never met, in faraway places, because stories are told, videos uploaded, and fragments shared, until they reach the places where we go to gather news.\nWe whistle songs from artists on other continents, and we have opinions about the politics of states we could barely find on a map. We form views about what this head of state is up to, about who is guilty in a famous case long before any legal process has played out, and about the private relationships of people we will never meet.\nOpinion has extended its reach far beyond the village.\nNearly everyone seems to have an opinion on nearly everything.\n(15) For most of human history, opinions were formed in settings where proximity, repetition, and feedback were abundant. You met and interacted with the people you judged. You lived with the consequences of your judgments. If an opinion was badly misattached, reality corrected it quickly.\n(16) The conditions we now find ourselves in are very different. Requests for opinion arrive through information channels we are connected to around the clock. They arrive without shared context, without any realistic path to action or verification, and without knowledge of the actors, the local rules, the history, or the environment.\nThe space of possibilities is large and unstable, yet belief is encouraged to attach early and firmly.\nThis is a structural mismatch.\n(17) Consider how easily we come to “know” who is guilty in a criminal case unfolding far away. Fragments of information circulate, interpretations accumulate, and long before evidence is weighed in a formal process, belief has already attached. The space of possibilities collapses prematurely. Later corrections, if they come at all, feel like revisions rather than clarifications.\nSomething similar happens in politics. We hold strong views on policies enacted in systems we cannot influence, among populations we do not know, under constraints we do not experience. Opinion forms, but without participation or responsibility. No action follows, except further expression.\nEven in moral matters, we are invited to judge people we will never meet, for actions we only know through filtered narratives. The question is posed as if it admitted of a clear answer, and belief attaches accordingly. But the underlying possibilities remain opaque, and feedback is absent.\nIn all these cases, opinion does not fail because it is irrational. It fails because it is applied outside the conditions under which it works well.\n(18) The cost of this mismatch is not primarily that opinions are wrong. It is that they are empty and without value.\nCognitively, attention is spent on judgments that cannot inform action. Emotionally, this produces fatigue, indignation, and a sense of constant urgency without resolution. Socially, it leads to boundary violations: being burdened with judgments one cannot act on, and being judged by people with no stake in the outcome.\nThere is also an epistemic cost. When belief attaches strongly in situations with little feedback, confidence grows without correction. Disagreement escalates, not because evidence accumulates, but because belief has already settled without evidence. That is what we are trained to do and get used to.\n(19) Opinion, in these settings, becomes expressive rather than orienting. It signals alignment, identity, or moral position, but it no longer helps navigate the world. What is expressed is not guidance for action, but affiliation in the absence of agency.\nIn this role, opinion does not coordinate behavior or improve understanding. It circulates without feedback, hardens without correction, and accumulates without consequence. Worse, this dynamic is increasingly exploited.\nIn the second century BCE, Carneades, head of the Academic school, visited Rome as part of an Athenian embassy. On one day, he delivered a powerful speech in praise of justice. The audience was convinced. On the next day, he argued with equal force that justice had no natural foundation at all, but was merely convention and expedience. The audience was again convinced.\nCarneades revealed that belief can be made to attach strongly in opposite directions, provided assent remains insulated from consequence. Belief attaches easily where nothing is at stake.\nThe reaction was not neutral. Cato the Elder, alarmed by the display, reportedly urged the Senate to send the philosophers home as quickly as possible. His concern was not that Carneades had disproved justice, but that he had shown how easily conviction could be manufactured without consequence. A population trained to admire rhetorical force over practical constraint, Cato feared, would become ungovernable.\nWhat Carneades exposed episodically has since been stabilized: assent without consequence has become easy to produce, and hard to escape.\n(20) At the same time, strategy has not disappeared. It continues to operate in domains where premature opinion has consequences: engineering, medicine, finance, security, exploration. There, possibilities remain open, belief stays provisional, and actions are chosen for robustness rather than correctness.\nProbability theory can be understood as a refinement of strategy. It keeps possibilities open while attaching graded expectations to them. Where its preconditions are met, this is extremely powerful. Where they are not, numbers can merely simulate control.\n(21) The result is an imbalance. Opinion has expanded into domains where strategy would be required, while strategy has retreated into domains where public expression is limited.\nThis imbalance is not stable. It creates pressure: on individuals, who are asked to judge without agency; and on public discourse, which becomes saturated with acted certainty but poor in coordination.\nUnderstanding this imbalance does not require nostalgia, nor does it require assigning blame. Opinion is now routinely applied far into domains where strategy would be better suited, and that this comes at a cost. How did a pattern this mismatched become ordinary without being deliberately chosen?\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/02-the-imbalance-of-opinion-and-strategy/","title":"2. The Imbalance Of Opinion And Strategy"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/03-fragments-of-an-explanation/":{"body":"(22) What follows is not an explanation in the strong sense. I will not pretend to know which forces mattered, which mattered most, how they interacted, or how to trace them through centuries in a way a historian would accept.\nStill, once we have seen the imbalance between opinion and strategy, it is hard not to ask how we got here. So I will do something weaker, and hopefully more honest. I will sketch fragments. Each fragment is a plausible contributor. Maybe together they will shed some light on the situation, and inspire more and better research.\n(23) A first fragment is philosophical.\nA large part of Western philosophy is organized around answers. Around opinions and their justification. Around what is true, what can be known, what must be accepted, what can be proven. This is not a criticism. It is simply what philosophy, in that tradition, decided to take seriously.\nPlato is an obvious reference point, because he set a tone that echoes down the centuries. Socrates himself, insofar as we can reconstruct him, may have been closer to the art of questioning than to the defense of answers. It is with Plato that the balance decisively shifts. A distinction is drawn between knowledge and mere opinion, between what is stable and what is shifting. A distinction that may be less absolute, and more practical, than it is often taken to be. Once that distinction is in the air, it becomes natural to treat having the right view as an achievement. And it becomes natural to treat uncertainty as a deficiency.\nThe logic of propositions grew sophisticated. The logic of questions remained a quiet corner. We became fluent in defending specific answers, less fluent in handling possibilities without one strong contender.\n(24) A second fragment is skeptical, and it is about a path not taken.\nThere was, early on, a viable alternative to a philosophy centered on answers. It did not deny reason, nor did it glorify ignorance. It took uncertainty seriously and tried to live with it. This alternative is usually gathered under the name skepticism.\nSkepticism, in its classical forms, did not primarily argue that nothing can be known. What it emphasized instead was restraint: restraint in assent, restraint in judgment, restraint in closing questions too quickly. Faced with competing answers that could not be decisively ranked, the skeptic did not rush to choose. Suspension of judgment was not a failure, but a practice.\nThis was a genuine alternative. It offered a way to inhabit uncertainty without collapsing into paralysis. It suggested that peace of mind and practical adequacy might come not from correct answers, but from not demanding more closure than a situation could support.\nBut skepticism never became a dominant cultural framework.\nPart of the reason is that it does not scale well institutionally. It does not produce clear doctrines. It does not anchor identity easily. It does not reward strong declarations. It offers no obvious badge of membership. It is difficult to teach as a set of conclusions, because it is not one. And within that framework it withered.\n(25) A third fragment is religious, and it is about the moral weight of belief.\nIn many religious traditions, belief is not merely a stance toward a proposition. It is an inward orientation. It can be loyal or disloyal. Pure or corrupt. Saving or damning. It is not only something one has, but something one is.\nChristianity is not the only tradition that moralizes belief, but in Europe it became a dominant cultural framework for a very long time. It taught generations to treat assent as a serious act. To treat wrong belief not merely as error, but as sin, heresy, or betrayal. Even when people later loosened their faith or rejected doctrine, parts of this moral grammar remained. Belief retained its weight. And under the right circumstances, perhaps rightly so.\nThis matters for our topic because it changes the social meaning of opinions. An opinion is no longer only a useful closure of a set of possibilities for practical navigation. It becomes a sign of character. A person's stance becomes readable as a person's virtue.\nWhen belief carries this kind of weight, it becomes harder to keep possibilities open calmly. It becomes harder to treat uncertainty as a normal condition.\n(26) A fourth fragment is educational and institutional.\nMost modern schooling trains us to answer. It trains us to produce the expected output under time pressure. It does not often train us to ask what kind of question we are facing, or what a responsible answer would even look like.\nThere are exceptions. Scientific education, at its best, teaches careful doubt and provisional models. Some forms of training in engineering, medicine, and law teach reasoning under constraints. But in the broad middle of education, success is measured by closure. By delivering the correct answer, not by managing the space of possibilities.\nEven in adult life, institutions often reward clarity over adequacy. Meetings want conclusions. Reports want recommendations. News wants a takeaway. A culture can become very productive under such pressures. But it also becomes impatient with the open-ended.\nThis is one way strategy gets fenced off. It survives in niches where uncertainty cannot be denied because consequences enforce it.\n(27) A fifth fragment is technological and economic.\nThe speed and scale of modern communication systems changed the ratio between information and action.\nFor most of human history, people heard about events in distant places through slow channels. News travelled with bodies. It arrived late, incomplete, and often without the power to demand a response. Today, information arrives immediately. It arrives in volume. It arrives with emotional framing. It arrives with social cues about what one is supposed to think.\nWe are informed far beyond our capacity to respond.\nThis is a simple fact with deep consequences. If one cannot act, one cannot close the loop. There is no feedback. There is no correction through consequence. Old opinions are like yesterday's news. \"Are we still talking about this?\" And the stream continues, and it continues to ask for orientation. It asks for alignment. It asks for judgment.\nIn such an environment, opinion becomes the default form of participation. It is a way to show that one is awake, informed, human, responsive. And it is increasingly a way to extract value, by assembling opinions into marketing profiles.\n(28) A sixth fragment is social.\nOpinion is cheap and strategy is expensive.\nAn opinion can be expressed quickly. It can be signaled. It can be shared. It can be rewarded. It can bind groups. It can create the feeling of being on the right side of something. It can be updated without much cost, when it is not tied to action anymore. The social environment can treat opinion as a kind of currency.\nStrategy requires patience. It requires restraint. It requires attention to constraints and tradeoffs. It requires admitting uncertainty. It often requires waiting. It can look cold when it is merely careful, and it can look cowardly when it is merely realistic.\nIn settings where people interact primarily through statements, the reward structure naturally favors statements. Not because people are shallow, but because statements are what can be exchanged. A culture of constant expression will favor the mode of reasoning that expresses easily.\n(29) A seventh fragment is professional.\nStrategy has not vanished. It has become specialized.\nIn domains where decisions have consequences and feedback is real, strategy is unavoidable. Engineers keep possibilities open because reality punishes premature closure. Doctors keep possibilities open because the wrong closure can harm a patient. Investors keep possibilities open because markets do not care about conviction. Security teams keep possibilities open because adversaries exploit certainty.\nIn such environments, the habits of strategy are cultivated, often explicitly. One learns to consider plausible alternatives. One learns to act robustly. One learns to revise when new information arrives. One learns to pay attention to consequences rather than to applause.\nBut these domains are often separated from public discourse. Their language can be technical. Their time horizons can be different. Their constraints can be invisible to outsiders. Their caution can be misread as evasiveness. Their refusal to close possibilities can be misread as lack of backbone.\nSo we end up in a strange situation. Strategy is alive, but it lives behind fences. Opinion is everywhere, because it travels well.\n(30) None of these fragments required bad intentions.\nIt is tempting to tell stories with villains. It is tempting to blame philosophers for corrupting common sense, religion for poisoning belief, or technology for destroying attention. But these are satisfying closures, not careful explanations.\nThe imbalance did not need to be planned to become pervasive. It could emerge from ordinary incentives and ordinary human traits. We like clarity. We like belonging. We like the feeling of having located ourselves. We do not like the discomfort of open questions. And we now live in systems that constantly present us with questions at scales we cannot inhabit.\nIf this sketch is even roughly correct, then the question is not primarily who is right. The question is how to live coherently under these conditions.\nThat question brings us back to the distinction we started with. Not as a theory, but as a practice.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/03-fragments-of-an-explanation/","title":"3. Fragments Of An Explanation"},"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/04-strategy-and-opinion/":{"body":"(31) Opinion commits strongly to a single view in order to act decisively.\nStrategy keeps several possibilities in play in order to act robustly when outcomes are uncertain.\nBoth are rational. Both are necessary. Both fail when applied outside the conditions under which they work.\nThe problem is not having opinions.\nThe problem is using the same kind of commitment everywhere.\n(32) Once this distinction is taken seriously, a practical question replaces a theoretical one.\nInstead of asking first, “What should I believe?”, the more basic question becomes:\n“What kind of situation is this?”\nSome situations reward decisive commitment.\nOthers punish it.\nSome situations offer fast feedback and correction.\nOthers do not.\nSome situations give you agency.\nOthers ask only for orientation or preparation.\n(33) Where feedback is local, consequences are shared, and revision is possible, opinion works well.\nStrong commitment is not a flaw there. It is what allows coordination and action.\nWhere feedback is delayed, agency is limited, and consequences are asymmetric or irreversible, strategy is a better choice.\nHere, premature certainty becomes a liability.\nThe same possibility, held with different degrees of commitment, can guide action in one context and mislead in another.\nAnd because people occupy different positions, with different access to feedback and consequence, what is a good opinion for one may be a poor one for someone else.\n(34) Seen from this angle, what has historically been called skepticism appears less as a rival position and more as a symptom of a missing distinction.\nMuch of philosophy proceeds as if opinion were the primary, or even the only, serious mode of thought. It asks what should be believed, defended, or justified, and treats full commitment as the natural posture of reason. Philosophical systems form by stacking commitment on commitment until they reach the sky. But where commitment outruns what a situation can support, tension builds.\nClassical skepticism emerges precisely at that limit. Faced with questions that do not admit of decisive closure, it refuses to follow opinion all the way. In its radical forms, it reacts by suspending assent almost everywhere. In its milder forms, it survives only locally, passively, and without reach.\nNeither response is sufficient on its own.\nOpinion, extended too far, hardens into dogma.\nSkepticism, extended too far, thins out the self that would have to commit at all, turning restraint into a constant burden and eroding the will to act.\nWhat both lacked was a clear way to distinguish where commitment is appropriate from where it is not.\nThat distinction becomes visible once opinion and strategy are separated as different ways of reasoning under different conditions.\n(35) From this perspective, skepticism does not need to be adopted, rejected, or rehabilitated.\nIts role becomes intelligible.\nHistorically, skepticism arises as a corrective where commitment outruns what a situation can support. It pushes back against the tendency of opinion to harden too quickly, to extend itself beyond the conditions that make it reliable.\nAs long as no other mode of reasoning is available, that corrective pressure has only two options: to follow opinion all the way, or to resist it almost everywhere. This is why skepticism so often appears either radical or thin.\nOnce strategy is recognized as a distinct way of reasoning under uncertainty, that pressure no longer needs to harden into a stance. The impulse behind skepticism can remain what it was at its best: restraint where restraint is warranted.\nWhat matters then is not allegiance to a philosophical position, but the practical ability to tell situations apart.\nSome situations call for strong commitment.\nOthers call for preparation, caution, or patience.\nKnowing the difference is not a theory to be defended.\nIt is a form of judgment exercised in practice.\n(36) What this perspective clarifies is a persistent confusion.\nThe strength of commitment that works well in small, lived contexts does not carry over unchanged to larger, more opaque ones.\nIn familiar settings, strong commitment is supported by direct experience, shared consequences, and the possibility of correction. There, opinion orients action.\nWhen the same degree of commitment is carried into situations where feedback is delayed, agency is limited, and consequences are diffuse or irreversible, it no longer orients. It hardens.\nThe error is not opinion itself, but treating one level of commitment as universally appropriate.\nLearning to adjust commitment to situation is not a matter of holding better views. It is a matter of recognizing what the situation can actually support.\n(37) This shift has concrete effects.\nIt changes what disagreement is about.\nWhen commitment is calibrated to situation, disagreement no longer has to signal ignorance, bad faith, or moral failure. It can remain what it often is in practice: a difference in assumptions, constraints, time horizons, or risk tolerance.\nThis alters the texture of conflict. Fewer disagreements are forced into the register of character and identity. Fewer positions have to be defended as verdicts about who someone is rather than judgments about what might work.\nDisagreement becomes something that can be explored rather than resolved, compared rather than won.\nUnder these conditions, coordination no longer depends on shared belief. It can proceed through shared awareness of uncertainty, tradeoffs, and limits.\nThe moral temperature drops not because people care less, but because fewer questions are asked to carry more weight than they can bear.\n(38) Within that space, other things become possible.\nIt becomes permissible not to have an opinion.\nSilence is acceptable where nothing useful can be said.\nPreparation becomes a legitimate response where judgment would only be an empty performance.\nThese changes are not dramatic. They do not promise wisdom or consensus.\nBut they alter what belief is asked to do. Commitment no longer has to outrun situation.\nMuch of the friction disappears simply because belief is no longer forced to carry work it cannot do.\n(39) In a world that constantly demands answers, this restraint can matter.\nWe are asked to judge situations we cannot influence and processes we cannot see through. Orientation is demanded where action is impossible. Opinion rushes in to fill the gap, and fatigue follows. And the feed is virtually infinite, so the demand never relaxes.\nA practical balance between opinion and strategy does not deny these conditions. It accepts them and adjusts commitment accordingly.\nNot every situation calls for judgment. Some call for preparation. Some call for waiting. Treating all of them as if they demanded belief is what drains attention and dulls responsibility.\n(40) Read this way, the distinction we began with comes into focus as a practice.\nNot a theory of the world, but a way of standing in it.\nNot a demand for certainty, but the ability to adjust commitment to situation.\nSome situations call for decisive judgment. Others call for patience, preparation, or restraint. Most call for something in between.\nBelief does not need to settle everything for life to go on. Action does not require certainty to be responsible.\nGiving opinion and strategy each their rightful place is a form of competence.\n","id":"https://stefankober.github.io/essays/opinion-and-strategy/04-strategy-and-opinion/","title":"4.
